Preface
This book helps students to master the material of a standard US undergraduate
ﬁrst course in Linear Algebra.
The material is standard in that the subjects covered are Gaussian reduction,
vector spaces, linear maps, determinants, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Another standard is the book’s audience: sophomores or juniors, usually with
a background of at least one semester of calculus. The help that it gives to
students comes from taking a developmental approach—this book’s presentation
emphasizes motivation and naturalness, using many examples.
The developmental approach is what most recommends this book so I will
elaborate. Courses at the beginning of a mathematics program focus less on
theory and more on calculating. Later courses ask for mathematical maturity: the
ability to follow diﬀerent types of arguments, a familiarity with the themes that
underlie many mathematical investigations such as elementary set and function
facts, and a capacity for some independent reading and thinking. Some programs
have a separate course devoted to developing maturity but in any case a Linear
Algebra course is an ideal spot to work on this transition. It comes early in a
program so that progress made here pays oﬀ later but it also comes late enough
so that the classroom contains only students who are serious about mathematics.
The material is accessible, coherent, and elegant. And, examples are plentiful.
Helping readers with their transition requires taking the mathematics seri-
ously. All of the results here are proved. On the other hand, we cannot assume
that students have already arrived and so in contrast with more advanced
texts this book is ﬁlled with illustrations of the theory, often quite detailed
illustrations.
Some texts that assume a not-yet sophisticated reader begin with matrix
multiplication and determinants. Then, when vector spaces and linear maps
ﬁnally appear and deﬁnitions and proofs start, the abrupt change brings the
students to an abrupt stop. While this book begins with linear reduction, from
the start we do more than compute. The ﬁrst chapter includes proofs, such as
the proof that linear reduction gives a correct and complete solution set. With
that as motivation the second chapter does vector spaces over the reals. In the
schedule below this happens at the start of the third week.
A student progresses most in mathematics by doing exercises. The problem
sets start with routine checks and range up to reasonably involved proofs. I
have aimed to typically put two dozen in each set, thereby giving a selection. In
particular there is a good number of the medium-diﬃcult problems that stretch
a learner, but not too far. At the high end, there are a few that are puzzles taken
from various journals, competitions, or problems collections, which are marked
with a ‘?’ (as part of the fun I have worked to keep the original wording).
That is, as with the rest of the book, the exercises are aimed to both build
an ability at, and help students experience the pleasure of,doing mathematics.
Students should see how the ideas arise and should be able to picture themselves
doing the same type of work.
Applications. Applications and computing are interesting and vital aspects of the
subject. Consequently, each chapter closes with a selection of topics in those
areas. These give a reader a taste of the subject, discuss how Linear Algebra
comes in, point to some further reading, and give a few exercises. They are
brief enough that an instructor can do one in a day’s class or can assign them
as projects for individuals or small groups. Whether they ﬁgure formally in a
course or not, they help readers see for themselves that Linear Algebra is a tool
that a professional must have.
Availability. This book is Free. Seehttp://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra
for the license details. That page also has the latest version, exercise answers,
beamer slides, lab manual, additional material, and LATEX source. This book is
also available in hard copy from standard publishing sources, for very little cost.
See the web page.
Acknowledgments. A lesson of software development is that complex projects
have bugs and need a process to ﬁx them. I am grateful for reports from both
instructors and students. I periodically issue revisions and acknowledge in the
book’s repository all of the reports that I use. My current contact information
is on the web page.
I am grateful to Saint Michael’s College for supporting this project over many
years, even before the idea of open educational resources became familiar.
And, I cannot thank my wife Lynne enough for her unﬂagging encouragement.
Advice. This book’s emphasis on motivation and development, and its availability,
make it widely used for self-study. If you are an independent student then good
for you, I admire your industry. However, you may ﬁnd some advice useful.
While an experienced instructor knows what subjects and pace suit their
class, this semester’s timetable (graciously shared by G Ashline) may help you
plan a sensible rate. It presumes that you have already studied the material of
Section One.II, the elements of vectors.

As enrichment, you could pick one or two extra things that appeal to you, from
the lab manual or from the Topics from the end of each chapter. I like the Topics
on Voting Paradoxes, Geometry of Linear Maps, and Coupled Oscillators. You’ll
get more from these if you have access to software for calculations such asSage,
freely available fromhttp://sagemath.org.
In the table of contents I have marked a few subsections as optional if some
instructors will pass over them in favor of spending more time elsewhere.
Note that in addition to the in-class exams, students in the above course do
take-home problem sets that include proofs, such as a veriﬁcation that a set is a
vector space. Computations are important but so are the arguments.
My main advice is: do many exercises. I have marked a good sample with
✓’s in the margin. Do not simply read the answers—you must try the problems
and possibly struggle with them. For all of the exercises, you must justify your
answer either with a computation or with a proof. Be aware that few people
can write correct proofs without training; try to ﬁnd a knowledgeable person to
work with you.
Finally, a caution for all students, independent or not: I cannot overemphasize
that the statement, “I understand the material but it is only that I have trouble
with the problems” shows a misconception. Being able to do things with the
ideas is their entire point. The quotes below express this sentiment admirably (I
have taken the liberty of formatting them as poetry). They capture the essence
of both the beauty and the power of mathematics and science in general, and of
Linear Algebra in particular.
I know of no better tactic
than the illustration of exciting principles
by well-chosen particulars.
–Stephen Jay Gould
If you really wish to learn
you must mount a machine
and become acquainted with its tricks
by actual trial.
–Wilbur Wright
In the particular
is contained the universal.

Author’s Note.Inventing a good exercise, one that enlightens as well as tests,
is a creative act, and hard work. The inventor deserves recognition. But texts
have traditionally not given attributions for questions. I have changed that here
where I was sure of the source. I would be glad to hear from anyone who can
help me to correctly attribute others of the questions.

Linear Systems
I Solving Linear Systems
Systems of linear equations are common in science and mathematics. These two
examples from high school science [Onan] give a sense of how they arise.
The ﬁrst example is from Statics. Suppose that we have three objects, we
know that one has a mass of 2 kg, and we want to ﬁnd the two unknown masses.
Experimentation with a meter stick produces these two balances.
ch 2
15
40 50
c h2
25 50
25
For the masses to balance we must have that the sum of moments on the left
equals the sum of moments on the right, where the moment of an object is its
mass times its distance from the balance point. That gives a system of two
linear equations.
40h +15c =100
25c =50 +50h
The second example is from Chemistry. We can mix, under controlled
conditions, toluene C7H8 and nitric acid HNO3 to produce trinitrotoluene
C7H5O6N3 along with the byproduct water (conditions have to be very well
controlled—trinitrotoluene is better known as TNT). In what proportion should
we mix them? The number of atoms of each element present before the reaction
xC7H8 + yHNO3 −→ zC7H5O6N3 + wH2O
2 Chapter One. Linear Systems
must equal the number present afterward. Applying that in turn to the elements
C, H, N, and O gives this system.
7x =7z
8x +1y =5z +2w
1y =3z
3y =6z +1w
Both examples come down to solving a system of equations. In each system,
the equations involve only the ﬁrst power of each variable. This chapter shows
how to solve any such system of equations.
I.1 Gauss’s Method
1.1 DeﬁnitionA linear combinationofx1, ..., xn has the form
a1x1 +a2x2 +a3x3 +··· +anxn
where the numbersa1,...,a n∈ R are the combination’scoeﬃcients. A linear
equation in the variablesx1, ..., xn has the forma1x1 +a2x2 +a3x3 +··· +
anxn =d whered∈ R is theconstant.
Ann-tuple (s1,s2,...,s n)∈ Rn is asolution of, orsatisﬁes, that equation
if substituting the numberss1, ..., sn for the variables gives a true statement:
a1s1 +a2s2 +··· +ansn =d. A system of linear equations
a1,1x1 + a1,2x2 +··· + a1,nxn = d1
a2,1x1 + a2,2x2 +··· + a2,nxn = d2
...
am,1x1 +am,2x2 +··· +am,nxn = dm
has the solution(s1,s2,...,s n) if thatn-tuple is a solution of all of the equations.
1.2 Example The combination3x1 +2x2 ofx1 andx2 is linear. The combination
3x2
1 +2x2 is not a linear function ofx1 andx2, nor is3x1 +2sin(x2).
We usually takex1, ..., xn to be unequal to each other because in a
sum with repeats we can rearrange to make the elements unique, as with
2x +3y +4x =6x +3y. We sometimes include terms with a zero coeﬃcient, as
inx −2y +0z, and at other times omit them, depending on what is convenient.
Section I. Solving Linear Systems 3
1.3 Example The ordered pair(−1,5 ) is a solution of this system.
3x1 +2x2 =7
−x1 + x2 =6
In contrast, (5, −1) is not a solution.
Findingthesetofallsolutionsis solving thesystem. Wedon’tneedguesswork
or good luck; there is an algorithm that always works. This algorithm isGauss’s
Method (or Gaussian elimination or linear elimination).
1.4 Example To solve this system
3x3 =9
x1 +5x2 −2x3 =2
1
3x1 +2x2 =3
we transform it, step by step, until it is in a form that we can easily solve.
The ﬁrst transformation rewrites the system by interchanging the ﬁrst and
third row.
swap row 1 with row 3
−→
1
3x1 +2x2 =3
x1 +5x2 −2x3 =2
3x3 =9
The second transformation rescales the ﬁrst row by a factor of3.
multiply row 1 by 3
−→
x1 +6x2 =9
x1 +5x2 −2x3 =2
3x3 =9
The third transformation is the only nontrivial one in this example. We mentally
multiply both sides of the ﬁrst row by−1, mentally add that to the second row,
and write the result in as the new second row.
add −1 times row 1 to row 2
−→
x1 + 6x2 = 9
−x2 −2x3 = −7
3x3 = 9
These steps have brought the system to a form where we can easily ﬁnd the
value of each variable. The bottom equation shows thatx3 =3. Substituting3
forx3 in the middle equation shows thatx2 =1. Substituting those two into
the top equation gives thatx1 =3. Thus the system has a unique solution; the
solution set is{ (3,1,3 ) }.
We will use Gauss’s Method throughout the book. It is fast and easy. We
will now show that it is also safe: Gauss’s Method never loses solutions nor does
it ever pick up extraneous solutions, so that a tuple is a solution to the system
before we apply the method if and only if it is a solution after.
4 Chapter One. Linear Systems
1.5 Theorem (Gauss’s Method)If a linear system is changed to another by one of
these operations
(1) an equation is swapped with another
(2) an equation has both sides multiplied by a nonzero constant
(3) an equation is replaced by the sum of itself and a multiple of another
then the two systems have the same set of solutions.
Each of the three operations has a restriction. Multiplying a row by0 is not
allowed because obviously that can change the solution set. Similarly, adding a
multiple of a row to itself is not allowed because adding−1 times the row to
itself has the eﬀect of multiplying the row by0. And we disallow swapping a
row with itself, to make some results in the fourth chapter easier. Besides, it’s
pointless.
Proof We will cover the equation swap operation here. The other two cases
are similar and are Exercise 33.
Consider a linear system.
a1,1x1 + a1,2x2 +··· + a1,nxn = d1
...
ai,1x1 + ai,2x2 +··· + ai,nxn = di
...
aj,1x1 + aj,2x2 +··· + aj,nxn = dj
...
am,1x1 +am,2x2 +··· +am,nxn = dm
The tuple (s1,...,s n) satisﬁes this system if and only if substituting the values
for the variables, thes’s for thex’s, gives a conjunction of true statements:
a1,1s1 +a1,2s2 +··· +a1,nsn =d1 and ... ai,1s1 +ai,2s2 +··· +ai,nsn =di and
... aj,1s1 +aj,2s2 +··· +aj,nsn =dj and ... am,1s1 +am,2s2 +··· +am,nsn =
dm.
In a list of statements joined with ‘and’ we can rearrange the order of the
statements. Thus this requirement is met if and only ifa1,1s1 +a1,2s2 +··· +
a1,nsn =d1 and ... aj,1s1 +aj,2s2 +··· +aj,nsn =dj and ... ai,1s1 +ai,2s2 +
··· +ai,nsn =di and ... am,1s1 +am,2s2 +··· +am,nsn =dm. This is exactly
the requirement that(s1,...,s n) solves the system after the row swap.QED
Section I. Solving Linear Systems 5
1.6 DeﬁnitionThe three operations from Theorem 1.5 are theelementary re-
duction operations, orrow operations, orGaussian operations. They are
swapping, multiplying by a scalar(or rescaling), androw combination.
When writing out the calculations, we will abbreviate ‘rowi’ by ‘ρi’ (this is
the Greek letter rho, pronounced aloud as “row”). For instance, we will denote
a row combination operation bykρi +ρj, with the row that changes written
second. To save writing we will often combine addition steps when they use the
sameρi, as in the next example.
1.7 Example Gauss’s Method systematically applies the row operations to solve
a system. Here is a typical case.
x + y =0
2x − y +3z =3
x −2y − z =3
We begin by using the ﬁrst row to eliminate the2x in the second row and thex
in the third. To get rid of the2x we mentally multiply the entire ﬁrst row by
−2, add that to the second row, and write the result in as the new second row.
To eliminate thex in the third row we multiply the ﬁrst row by−1, add that to
the third row, and write the result in as the new third row.
−2ρ1+ρ2
−→
−ρ1+ρ3
x + y =0
−3y +3z =3
−3y − z =3
We ﬁnish by transforming the second system into a third, where the bottom
equation involves only one unknown. We do that by using the second row to
eliminate they term from the third row.
−ρ2+ρ3
−→
x + y =0
−3y + 3z =3
−4z =0
Now ﬁnding the system’s solution is easy. The third row givesz =0. Substitute
that back into the second row to gety = −1. Then substitute back into the ﬁrst
row to getx =1.
1.8 Example For the Physics problem from the start of this chapter, Gauss’s
Method gives this.
40h +15c =100
−50h +25c = 50
5/4ρ1+ρ2
−→ 40h + 15c =100
(175/4)c =175
Soc =4, and back-substitution gives thath =1. (We will solve the Chemistry
problem later.)

−(3/2)ρ2+ρ3
−→
x + y + z = 9
2y − 5z = − 17
−(1/2)z = −(3/2)
shows thatz =3,y = −1, andx =7.
As illustrated above, the point of Gauss’s Method is to use the elementary
reduction operations to set up back-substitution.
1.10 DeﬁnitionIn each row of a system, the ﬁrst variable with a nonzero coeﬃcient
is the row’sleading variable. A system is in echelon form if each leading
variable is to the right of the leading variable in the row above it, except for the
leading variable in the ﬁrst row, and any rows with all-zero coeﬃcients are at
the bottom.
1.11 Example The prior three examples only used the operation of row combina-
tion. This linear system requires the swap operation to get it into echelon form
because after the ﬁrst combination
x − y =0
2x −2y + z +2w =4
y + w =0
2z + w =5
−2ρ1+ρ2
−→
x −y =0
z +2w =4
y + w =0
2z + w =5
the second equation has no leadingy. We exchange it for a lower-down row that
has a leadingy.
ρ2↔ρ3
−→
x −y =0
y + w =0
z +2w =4
2z + w =5
(Had there been more than one suitable row below the second then we could
have used any one.) With that, Gauss’s Method proceeds as before.
−2ρ3+ρ4
−→
x −y = 0
y + w = 0
z + 2w = 4
−3w = −3
Back-substitution givesw =1,z =2 ,y = −1, andx = −1.
Section I. Solving Linear Systems 7
Strictly speaking, to solve linear systems we don’t need the row rescaling
operation. We have introduced it here because it is convenient and because we
will use it later in this chapter as part of a variation of Gauss’s Method, the
Gauss-Jordan Method.
All of the systems so far have the same number of equations as unknowns.
All of them have a solution and for all of them there is only one solution. We
ﬁnish this subsection by seeing other things that can happen.
1.12 Example This system has more equations than variables.
x +3y = 1
2x + y = −3
2x +2y = −2
Gauss’s Method helps us understand this system also, since this
−2ρ1+ρ2
−→
−2ρ1+ρ3
x + 3y = 1
−5y = −5
−4y = −4
shows that one of the equations is redundant. Echelon form
−(4/5)ρ2+ρ3
−→
x + 3y = 1
−5y = −5
0 = 0
gives thaty =1 andx = −2. The ‘0 =0’ reﬂects the redundancy.
Gauss’s Method is also useful on systems with more variables than equations.
The next subsection has many examples.
Another way that linear systems can diﬀer from the examples shown above
is that some linear systems do not have a unique solution. This can happen in
two ways. The ﬁrst is that a system can fail to have any solution at all.
1.13 Example Contrast the system in the last example with this one.
x +3y = 1
2x + y = −3
2x +2y = 0
−2ρ1+ρ2
−→
−2ρ1+ρ3
x + 3y = 1
−5y = −5
−4y = −2
Here the system is inconsistent: no pair of numbers(s1,s2) satisﬁes all three
equations simultaneously. Echelon form makes the inconsistency obvious.
−(4/5)ρ2+ρ3
−→
x + 3y = 1
−5y = −5
0 = 2
The solution set is empty.
8 Chapter One. Linear Systems
1.14 Example The prior system has more equations than unknowns but that
is not what causes the inconsistency—Example 1.12 has more equations than
unknowns and yet is consistent. Nor is having more equations than unknowns
necessary for inconsistency, as we see with this inconsistent system that has the
same number of equations as unknowns.
x +2y =8
2x +4y =8
−2ρ1+ρ2
−→ x +2y = 8
0 = −8
Instead, inconsistency has to do with the interaction of the left and right sides;
in the ﬁrst system above the left side’s second equation is twice the ﬁrst but the
right side’s second constant is not twice the ﬁrst. Later we will have more to
say about dependencies between a system’s parts.
The other way that a linear system can fail to have a unique solution, besides
having no solutions, is to have many solutions.
1.15 Example In this system
x + y =4
2x +2y =8
any pair of numbers satisfying the ﬁrst equation also satisﬁes the second. The
solution set { (x,y ) |x +y =4 } is inﬁnite; some example member pairs are(0,4 ),
(−1,5 ), and (2.5,1.5 ).
The result of applying Gauss’s Method here contrasts with the prior example
because we do not get a contradictory equation.
−2ρ1+ρ2
−→ x +y =4
0 =0
Don’t be fooled by that example: a0 =0 equation is not the signal that a
system has many solutions.
1.16 Example The absence of a0 =0 equation does not keep a system from having
many diﬀerent solutions. This system is in echelon form, has no0 = 0, but
has inﬁnitely many solutions, including(0,1, −1), (0,1/2, −1/2), (0,0,0 ), and
(0, −π,π ) (any triple whose ﬁrst component is0 and whose second component
is the negative of the third is a solution).
x +y +z =0
y +z =0
Nor does the presence of0 = 0 mean that the system must have many
solutions. Example 1.12 shows that. So does this system, which does not have
Section I. Solving Linear Systems 9
any solutions at all despite that in echelon form it has a0 =0 row.
2x −2z =6
y + z =1
2x + y − z =7
3y +3z =0
−ρ1+ρ3
−→
2x −2z =6
y + z =1
y + z =1
3y +3z =0
−ρ2+ρ3
−→
−3ρ2+ρ4
2x −2z = 6
y + z = 1
0 = 0
0 = −3
In summary, Gauss’s Method uses the row operations to set a system up for
back substitution. If any step shows a contradictory equation then we can stop
with the conclusion that the system has no solutions. If we reach echelon form
without a contradictory equation, and each variable is a leading variable in its
row, then the system has a unique solution and we ﬁnd it by back substitution.
Finally, if we reach echelon form without a contradictory equation, and there is
not a unique solution—that is, at least one variable is not a leading variable—
then the system has many solutions.
The next subsection explores the third case. We will see that such a system
must have inﬁnitely many solutions and we will describe the solution set.
Note. In the exercises here, and in the rest of the book, you must justify all
of your answers. For instance, if a question asks whether a system has a
solution then you must justify a yes response by producing the solution and
must justify a no response by showing that no solution exists.

✓ 1.21 We can solve linear systems by methods other than Gauss’s. One often taught
in high school is to solve one of the equations for a variable, then substitute the
resulting expression into other equations. Then we repeat that step until there
is an equation with only one variable. From that we get the ﬁrst number in the
solution and then we get the rest with back-substitution. This method takes longer
than Gauss’s Method, since it involves more arithmetic operations, and is also
more likely to lead to errors. To illustrate how it can lead to wrong conclusions,
we will use the system
x +3y = 1
2x + y = −3
2x +2y = 0
from Example 1.13.

with no abstentions. It was found that 11 members, a majority, preferredA over
B (thus the other 9 preferredB overA). Similarly, it was found that 12 members
preferredC overA. Given these results, it was suggested thatB should withdraw,
to enable a runoﬀ election betweenA andC. However,B protested, and it was
then found that 14 members preferredB overC! The Board has not yet recovered
from the resulting confusion. Given that every possible order ofA,B,C appeared

“It’s all so clear when you explain it!” said the Poor Nut. “Do you mean like

“Quite so,” said the Great Mathematician, pulling out his bassoon. “Indeed,

“Good heavens!” cried the Poor Nut, “I am baﬄed.”
Are you?
Section I. Solving Linear Systems 13
I.2 Describing the Solution Set
A linear system with a unique solution has a solution set with one element. A
linear system with no solution has a solution set that is empty. In these cases
the solution set is easy to describe. Solution sets are a challenge to describe only
when they contain many elements.
2.1 Example This system has many solutions because in echelon form
2x +z =3
x −y −z =1
3x −y =4
−(1/2)ρ1+ρ2
−→
−(3/2)ρ1+ρ3
2x + z = 3
−y − (3/2)z = −1/2
−y − (3/2)z = −1/2
−ρ2+ρ3
−→
2x + z = 3
−y − (3/2)z = −1/2
0 = 0
not all of the variables are leading variables. Theorem 1.5 shows that an(x,y,z )
satisﬁes the ﬁrst system if and only if it satisﬁes the third. So we can describe
the solution set{(x,y,z ) |2x +z =3 andx −y −z =1 and3x −y =4 } in this
way.
{ (x,y,z ) |2x +z =3 and −y −3z/2 = −1/2 } (∗)
This description is better because it has two equations instead of three but it is
not optimal because it still has some hard to understand interactions among the
variables.
To improve it, use the variable that does not lead any equation,z, to describe
the variables that do lead,x andy. The second equation givesy = (1/2)−(3/2)z
and the ﬁrst equation givesx = (3/2)−(1/2)z. Thus we can describe the solution
set as this set of triples.
{ ((3/2) − (1/2)z, (1/2) − (3/2)z,z ) |z∈ R } (∗∗)
Compared with (∗), the advantage of (∗∗) is thatz can be any real number.
This makes the job of deciding which tuples are in the solution set much easier.
For instance, takingz =2 shows that (1/2, −5/2,2 ) is a solution.
2.2 DeﬁnitionIn an echelon form linear system the variables that are not leading
are free.
2.3 Example Reduction of a linear system can end with more than one variable

ρ2+ρ4
x +y +z −w = 1

leavesx andy leading and bothz andw free. To get the description that we
prefer, we work from the bottom. We ﬁrst express the leading variabley in terms
ofz andw, asy = −1 +z −w. Moving up to the top equation, substituting for
y givesx + (−1 +z −w) +z −w =1 and solving forx leavesx =2 −2z +2w.
The solution set
{ (2 −2z +2w, −1 +z −w,z,w ) |z,w∈ R } (∗∗)
has the leading variables expressed in terms of the variables that are free.
2.4 Example The list of leading variables may skip over some columns. After
this reduction
2x −2y =0
z +3w =2
3x −3y =0
x − y +2z +6w =4

0 =0
2z +6w =4
−2ρ2+ρ4
−→
2x −2y =0
z +3w =2
0 =0
0 =0
x andz are the leading variables, notx andy. The free variables arey andw
and so we can describe the solution set as{(y,y,2 −3w,w ) |y,w∈ R }. For
instance, (1,1,2,0 ) satisﬁes the system—takey =1 andw =0. The four-tuple
(1,0,5,4 ) is not a solution since its ﬁrst coordinate does not equal its second.
A variable that we use to describe a family of solutions is aparameter. We
say that the solution set in the prior example isparametrized withy andw.
The terms ‘parameter’ and ‘free variable’ do not mean the same thing. In the
prior exampley andw are free because in the echelon form system they do not
lead. They are parameters because we used them to describe the set of solutions.
Had we instead rewritten the second equation asw =2/3 − (1/3)z then the free
variables would still bey andw but the parameters would bey andz.
Section I. Solving Linear Systems 15
In the rest of this book we will solve linear systems by bringing them to
echelon form and then parametrizing with the free variables.
2.5 Example This is another system with inﬁnitely many solutions.
x +2y =1
2x +z =2
3x +2y +z −w =4
−2ρ1+ρ2
−→
−3ρ1+ρ3
x + 2y =1
−4y +z =0
−4y +z −w =1
−ρ2+ρ3
−→
x + 2y =1
−4y +z =0
−w =1
The leading variables arex, y, andw. The variable z is free. Notice that,
although there are inﬁnitely many solutions, the value ofw doesn’t vary but
is constantw = −1. To parametrize, writew in terms ofz withw = −1 +0z.
Theny = (1/4)z. Substitute fory in the ﬁrst equation to getx =1 − (1/2)z.
The solution set is{(1 − (1/2)z, (1/4)z,z, −1) |z∈ R }.
Parametrizing solution sets shows that systems with free variables have
inﬁnitely many solutions. For instance, abovez takes on all of inﬁnitely many
real number values, each associated with a diﬀerent solution.
We ﬁnish this subsection by developing a streamlined notation for linear
systems and their solution sets.
2.6 DeﬁnitionAnm×n matrix is a rectangular array of numbers withm rows
andn columns. Each number in the matrix is anentry.
We usually denote a matrix with an upper case roman letter. For instance,
A =
(
1 2.2 5
3 4 −7
)
has2 rows and3 columns and so is a2×3 matrix. Read that aloud as “two-by-
three”; the number of rows is always stated ﬁrst. (The matrix has parentheses
around it so that when two matrices are adjacent we can tell where one ends and
the other begins.) We name matrix entries with the corresponding lower-case
letter, so that the entry in the second row and ﬁrst column of the above array
isa2,1 =3. Note that the order of the subscripts matters:a1,2⁄=a2,1 since
a1,2 =2.2. We denote the set of allm×n matrices by Mm×n.
We do Gauss’s Method using matrices in essentially the same way that we
did it for systems of equations: a matrix row’sleading entryis its ﬁrst nonzero
entry (if it has one) and we perform row operations to arrive atmatrix echelon
form, where the leading entry in lower rows are to the right of those in the rows

above. We like matrix notation because it lightens the clerical load, the copying
of variables and the writing of+’s and=’s.
2.7 Example We can abbreviate this linear system
x +2y =4
y − z =0
x +2z =4
with this matrix. 

1 2 0 4
0 1 −1 0
1 0 2 4


The vertical bar reminds a reader of the diﬀerence between the coeﬃcients on
the system’s left hand side and the constants on the right. With a bar, this is
an augmented matrix.

The second row stands fory −z =0 and the ﬁrst row stands forx +2y =4 so
the solution set is{(4 −2z,z,z ) |z∈ R }.
Matrix notation also clariﬁes the descriptions of solution sets. Example 2.3’s
{ (2 −2z +2w, −1 +z −w,z,w ) |z,w∈ R } is hard to read. We will rewrite it
to group all of the constants together, all of the coeﬃcients ofz together, and
all of the coeﬃcients ofw together. We write them vertically, in one-column
matrices.

For instance, the top line says thatx =2 −2z +2w and the second line says
thaty = −1 +z −w. (Our next section gives a geometric interpretation that
will help us picture the solution sets.)
2.8 DeﬁnitionA column vector, often just called avector, is a matrix with a
single column. A matrix with a single row is arow vector. The entries of
a vector are sometimes calledcomponents. A column or row vector whose
components are all zeros is azero vector.
Vectors are an exception to the convention of representing matrices with
capital roman letters. We use lower-case roman or greek letters overlined with an

A zero vector is denoted⃗0. There are many diﬀerent zero vectors—the one-tall
zero vector, the two-tall zero vector, etc.—but nonetheless we will often say
“the” zero vector, expecting that the size will be clear from the context.
2.9 DeﬁnitionThe linear equationa1x1 +a2x2 +··· +anxn =d with unknowns
x1,...,x n is satisﬁedby
⃗s =


s1
...
sn


ifa1s1 +a2s2 +··· +ansn =d. A vector satisﬁes a linear system if it satisﬁes
each equation in the system.
The style of description of solution sets that we use involves adding the
vectors, and also multiplying them by real numbers. Before we give the examples
showing the style we ﬁrst need to deﬁne these operations.
2.10 DeﬁnitionThe vector sumof ⃗u and ⃗v is the vector of the sums.
⃗u + ⃗v =


u1
...
un

 +


v1
...
vn

 =


u1 +v1
...
un +vn


Note that for the addition to be deﬁned the vectors must have the same
number of entries. This entry-by-entry addition works for any pair of matrices,
not just vectors, provided that they have the same number of rows and columns.
2.11 DeﬁnitionThe scalar multiplicationof the real numberr and the vector⃗v
is the vector of the multiples.
r· ⃗v =r·


v1
...
vn

 =


rv1
...
rvn


As with the addition operation, the entry-by-entry scalar multiplication
operation extends beyond vectors to apply to any matrix.
18 Chapter One. Linear Systems
We write scalar multiplication either asr· ⃗v or ⃗v·r, and sometimes even
omit the ‘·’ symbol:r⃗v. (Do not refer to scalar multiplication as ‘scalar product’
because that name is for a diﬀerent operation.)

Observe that the deﬁnitions of addition and scalar multiplication agree where
they overlap; for instance,⃗v + ⃗v =2⃗v.
With these deﬁnitions, we are set to use matrix and vector notation to both
solve systems and express the solution.

Before the exercises, we will consider what we have accomplished and what
we will do in the remainder of the chapter. So far we have done the mechanics
of Gauss’s Method. We have not stopped to consider any of the questions that
arise, except for proving Theorem 1.5—which justiﬁes the method by showing
that it gives the right answers.
For example, can we always describe solution sets as above, with a particular
solution vector added to an unrestricted linear combination of some other vectors?
20 Chapter One. Linear Systems
We’ve noted that the solution sets described in this way have inﬁnitely many
members so answering this question would tell us about the size of solution sets.
The following subsection shows that the answer is “yes.” This chapter’s second
section then uses that answer to describe the geometry of solution sets.
Other questions arise from the observation that we can do Gauss’s Method
in more than one way (for instance, when swapping rows we may have a choice
of rows to swap with). Theorem 1.5 says that we must get the same solution set
no matter how we proceed but if we do Gauss’s Method in two ways must we
get the same number of free variables in each echelon form system? Must those
be the same variables, that is, is it impossible to solve a problem one way to get
y andw free and solve it another way to gety andz free? The third section
of this chapter answers “yes,” that from any starting linear system, all derived
echelon form versions have the same free variables.
Thus, by the end of the chapter we will not only have a solid grounding in
the practice of Gauss’s Method but we will also have a solid grounding in the
theory. We will know exactly what can and cannot happen in a reduction.

I.3 General = Particular + Homogeneous
In the prior subsection the descriptions of solution sets all ﬁt a pattern. They
have a vector that is a particular solution of the system added to an unre-
stricted combination of some other vectors. The solution set from Example 2.13
illustrates.

The combination is unrestricted in thatw andu can be any real numbers—
there is no condition like “such that2w −u =0” to restrict which pairsw,u we
can use.
That example shows an inﬁnite solution set ﬁtting the pattern. The other
two kinds of solution sets also ﬁt. A one-element solution set ﬁts because it has
a particular solution and the unrestricted combination part is trivial. That is,
instead of being a combination of two vectors or of one vector, it is a combination
of no vectors. (By convention the sum of an empty set of vectors is the zero
vector.) An empty solution set ﬁts the pattern because there is no particular
solution and thus there are no sums of that form.
24 Chapter One. Linear Systems
3.1 Theorem Any linear system’s solution set has the form
{⃗p +c1⃗β1 +··· +ck⃗βk |c1,...,c k∈ R }
where ⃗p is any particular solution and where the number of vectors⃗β1, ...,
⃗βk equals the number of free variables that the system has after a Gaussian
reduction.
The solution description has two parts, the particular solution⃗p and the
unrestricted linear combination of the⃗β’s. We shall prove the theorem with two
corresponding lemmas.
We will focus ﬁrst on the unrestricted combination. For that we consider
systems that have the vector of zeroes as a particular solution so that we can
shorten ⃗p +c1⃗β1 +··· +ck⃗βk toc1⃗β1 +··· +ck⃗βk.
3.2 DeﬁnitionA linear equation ishomogeneous if it has a constant of zero, so
that it can be written asa1x1 +a2x2 +··· +anxn =0.
3.3 Example With any linear system like
3x +4y =3
2x − y =1
we associate a system of homogeneous equations by setting the right side to
zeros.
3x +4y =0
2x − y =0

3x +4y =3
2x − y =1
−(2/3)ρ1+ρ2
−→ 3x + 4y =3

3x +4y =0
2x − y =0
−(2/3)ρ1+ρ2
−→ 3x + 4y =0
−(11/3)y =0
Obviously the two reductions go in the same way. We can study how to reduce
a linear system by instead studying how to reduce the associated homogeneous
system.
Studying the associated homogeneous system has a great advantage over
studying the original system. Nonhomogeneous systems can be inconsistent.
But a homogeneous system must be consistent since there is always at least one
solution, the zero vector.

3.6 Lemma For any homogeneous linear system there exist vectors⃗β1, ..., ⃗βk
such that the solution set of the system is
{c1⃗β1 +··· +ck⃗βk |c1,...,c k∈ R }
wherek is the number of free variables in an echelon form version of the system.
We will make two points before the proof. The ﬁrst is that the basic idea of
the proof is straightforward. Consider this system of homogeneous equations in

x +y +2z +u +v =0
y + z +u −v =0
u +v =0
Start with the bottom equation. Express its leading variable in terms of the
free variables withu = −v. For the next row up, substitute for the leading
variableu of the row belowy +z + (−v) −v =0 and solve for this row’s leading
variabley = −z +2v. Iterate: on the next row up, substitute expressions found
in lower rowsx + (−z +2v) +2z + (−v) +v =0 and solve for the leading variable
x = −z −2v. To ﬁnish, write the solution in vector notation

and recognize that the⃗β1 and ⃗β2 of the lemma are the vectors associated with
the free variablesz andv.
The prior paragraph is an example, not a proof. But it does suggest the
second point about the proof, its approach. The example moves row-by-row up
the system, using the equations from lower rows to do the next row. This points
to doing the proof by mathematical induction.∗
Induction is an important and non-obvious proof technique that we shall
use a number of times in this book. We will do proofs by induction in two
steps, a base step and an inductive step. In the base step we verify that the
statement is true for some ﬁrst instance, here that for the bottom equation we
can write the leading variable in terms of free variables. In the inductive step
we must establish an implication, that if the statement is true for all prior cases
then it follows for the present case also. Here we will establish that if for the
bottom-most t rows we can express the leading variables in terms of the free
variables, then for thet +1-th row from the bottom we can also express the
leading variable in terms of those that are free.
Those two steps together prove the statement for all the rows because by
the base step it is true for the bottom equation, and by the inductive step the
fact that it is true for the bottom equation shows that it is true for the next one
up. Then another application of the inductive step implies that it is true for the
third equation up, etc.
Proof Apply Gauss’s Method to get to echelon form. There may be some0 =0
equations; we ignore these (if the system consists only of0 =0 equations then
∗ More information on mathematical induction is in the appendix.
Section I. Solving Linear Systems 27
the lemma is trivially true because there are no leading variables). But because
the system is homogeneous there are no contradictory equations.
We will use induction to verify that each leading variable can be expressed
in terms of free variables. That will ﬁnish the proof because we can use the free
variables as parameters and the⃗β’s are the vectors of coeﬃcients of those free
variables.
For the base step consider the bottom-most equation
am,𝓁mx𝓁m +am,𝓁m+1x𝓁m+1 +··· +am,nxn =0 (∗)
where am,𝓁m ⁄= 0. (Here ‘𝓁’ stands for “leading” so thatx𝓁m is the leading
variable in rowm.) This is the bottom row so any variables after the leading
one must be free. Move these to the right hand side and divide byam,𝓁m
x𝓁m = (−am,𝓁m+1/am,𝓁m)x𝓁m+1 +··· + (−am,n/am,𝓁m)xn
to express the leading variable in terms of free variables. (There is a tricky
technical point here: if in the bottom equation (∗) there are no variables to
the right ofxlm then x𝓁m = 0. This satisﬁes the statement we are verifying
because, as alluded to at the start of this subsection, it hasx𝓁m written as a
sum of a number of the free variables, namely as the sum of zero many, under
the convention that a trivial sum totals to0.)
For the inductive step assume that the statement holds for the bottom-most
t rows, with0 ⩽t<m −1. That is, assume that for them-th equation, and
the (m −1)-th equation, etc., up to and including the(m −t)-th equation, we
can express the leading variable in terms of free ones. We must verify that
this then also holds for the next equation up, the(m − (t +1))-th equation.
For that, take each variable that leads in a lower equationx𝓁m, ..., x𝓁m−t and
substitute its expression in terms of free variables. We only need expressions
for leading variables from lower equations because the system is in echelon
form, so the leading variables in equations above this one do not appear in
this equation. The result has a leading term ofam−(t+1),𝓁m−(t+1)x𝓁m−(t+1)
with am−(t+1),𝓁m−(t+1) ⁄= 0, and the rest of the left hand side is a linear
combination of free variables. Move the free variables to the right side and divide
byam−(t+1),𝓁m−(t+1) to end with this equation’s leading variablex𝓁m−(t+1) in
terms of free variables.
We have done both the base step and the inductive step so by the principle
of mathematical induction the proposition is true. QED
This shows, as discussed between the lemma and its proof, that we can
parametrize solution sets using the free variables. We say that the set of
vectors {c1⃗β1 +··· +ck⃗βk |c1,...,c k∈ R } is generated byor spanned bythe
set { ⃗β1,..., ⃗βk }.
28 Chapter One. Linear Systems
To ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 3.1 the next lemma considers the particular
solution part of the solution set’s description.
3.7 Lemma For a linear system and for any particular solution⃗p, the solution
set equals {⃗p + ⃗h | ⃗h satisﬁes the associated homogeneous system}.
Proof We will show mutual set inclusion, that any solution to the system is in
the above set and that anything in the set is a solution of the system.∗
For set inclusion the ﬁrst way, that if a vector solves the system then it is in
the set described above, assume that⃗s solves the system. Then⃗s − ⃗p solves the
associated homogeneous system since for each equation indexi,
ai,1(s1 −p1) +··· +ai,n(sn −pn)
= (ai,1s1 +··· +ai,nsn) − (ai,1p1 +··· +ai,npn) =di −di =0
wherepj andsj are thej-th components of⃗p and ⃗s. Express ⃗s in the required
⃗p + ⃗h form by writing⃗s − ⃗p as ⃗h.
For set inclusion the other way, take a vector of the form⃗p + ⃗h, where ⃗p
solves the system and⃗h solves the associated homogeneous system and note
that ⃗p + ⃗h solves the given system since for any equation indexi,
ai,1(p1 +h1) +··· +ai,n(pn +hn)
= (ai,1p1 +··· +ai,npn) + (ai,1h1 +··· +ai,nhn) =di +0 =di
where as earlierpj andhj are thej-th components of⃗p and ⃗h. QED
The two lemmas together establish Theorem 3.1. Remember that theorem
with the slogan, “General= Particular +Homogeneous”.

So, as discussed at the start of this subsection, in this single-solution case the
general solution results from taking the particular solution and adding to it the
unique solution of the associated homogeneous system.
3.9 Example The start of this subsection also discusses that the case where
the general solution set is empty ﬁts theGeneral = Particular +Homogeneous
pattern too. This system illustrates.

Nonetheless, because the original system has no particular solution, its general
solution set is empty—there are no vectors of the form⃗p + ⃗h because there are
no ⃗p’s.
3.10 Corollary Solution sets of linear systems are either empty, have one element,
or have inﬁnitely many elements.
30 Chapter One. Linear Systems
Proof We’ve seen examples of all three happening so we need only prove that
there are no other possibilities.
First observe a homogeneous system with at least one non-⃗0 solution ⃗v has
inﬁnitely many solutions. This is because any scalar multiple of⃗v also solves the
homogeneous system and there are inﬁnitely many vectors in the set of scalar
multiples of⃗v: ifs,t∈ R are unequal thens⃗v⁄=t⃗v, sinces⃗v −t⃗v = (s −t)⃗v is
non-⃗0 as any non-0 component of⃗v, when rescaled by the non-0 factors −t, will
give a non-0 value.
Now apply Lemma 3.7 to conclude that a solution set
{⃗p + ⃗h | ⃗h solves the associated homogeneous system}
is either empty (if there is no particular solution⃗p), or has one element (if there
is a ⃗p and the homogeneous system has the unique solution⃗0), or is inﬁnite (if
there is a⃗p and the homogeneous system has a non-⃗0 solution, and thus by the
prior paragraph has inﬁnitely many solutions). QED

The dimension on the top of the table is the simpler one. When we perform
Gauss’s Method on a linear system, ignoring the constants on the right side and
so paying attention only to the coeﬃcients on the left-hand side, we either end
with every variable leading some row or else we ﬁnd some variable that does not
lead a row, that is, we ﬁnd some variable that is free. (We formalize “ignoring
the constants on the right” by considering the associated homogeneous system.)
A notable special case is systems having the same number of equations as
unknowns. Such a system will have a solution, and that solution will be unique,
if and only if it reduces to an echelon form system where every variable leads its
row (since there are the same number of variables as rows), which will happen if
and only if the associated homogeneous system has a unique solution.
3.11 DeﬁnitionA square matrix isnonsingular if it is the matrix of coeﬃcients
of a homogeneous system with a unique solution. It issingular otherwise, that
is, if it is the matrix of coeﬃcients of a homogeneous system with inﬁnitely many
solutions.
Section I. Solving Linear Systems 31
3.12 Example The ﬁrst of these matrices is nonsingular while the second is
singular (
1 2
3 4
) (
1 2
3 6
)
because the ﬁrst of these homogeneous systems has a unique solution while the
second has inﬁnitely many solutions.
x +2y =0
3x +4y =0
x +2y =0
3x +6y =0
We have made the distinction in the deﬁnition because a system with the same
number of equations as variables behaves in one of two ways, depending on
whether its matrix of coeﬃcients is nonsingular or singular. Where the matrix
of coeﬃcients is nonsingular the system has a unique solution for any constants
on the right side: for instance, Gauss’s Method shows that this system
x +2y =a
3x +4y =b
has the unique solutionx =b−2a andy = (3a−b)/2. On the other hand, where
the matrix of coeﬃcients is singular the system never has a unique solution—it
has either no solutions or else has inﬁnitely many, as with these.
x +2y =1
3x +6y =2
x +2y =1
3x +6y =3
The deﬁnition uses the word ‘singular’ because it means “departing from
general expectation.” People often, naively, expect that systems with the same
number of variables as equations will have a unique solution. Thus, we can think
of the word as connoting “troublesome,” or at least “not ideal.” (That ‘singular’
applies to those systems that never have exactly one solution is ironic but it is
the standard term.)
3.13 Example The systems from Example 3.3, Example 3.4, and Example 3.8
each have an associated homogeneous system with a unique solution. Thus these
matrices are nonsingular.

The table above has two dimensions. We have considered the one on top: we
can tell into which column a given linear system goes solely by considering the
system’s left-hand side; the constants on the right-hand side play no role in this.
The table’s other dimension, determining whether a particular solution exists,
is tougher. Consider these two systems with the same left side but diﬀerent
right sides.
3x +2y =5
3x +2y =5
3x +2y =5
3x +2y =4
The ﬁrst has a solution while the second does not, so here the constants on the
right side decide if the system has a solution. We could conjecture that the left
side of a linear system determines the number of solutions while the right side
determines if solutions exist but that guess is not correct. Compare these two,
with the same right sides but diﬀerent left sides.
3x +2y =5
4x +2y =4
3x +2y =5
3x +2y =4
The ﬁrst has a solution but the second does not. Thus the constants on the
right side of a system don’t alone determine whether a solution exists. Rather,
that depends on some interaction between the left and right.
For some intuition about that interaction, consider this system with one of
the coeﬃcients left unspeciﬁed, as the variablec.
x +2y +3z =1
x + y + z =1
cx +3y +4z =0
If c =2 then this system has no solution because the left-hand side has the
third row as the sum of the ﬁrst two, while the right-hand does not. Ifc⁄=2
then this system has a unique solution (try it withc =1). For a system to
have a solution, if one row of the matrix of coeﬃcients on the left is a linear
combination of other rows then on the right the constant from that row must be
the same combination of constants from the same rows.
More intuition about the interaction comes from studying linear combinations.
That will be our focus in the second chapter, after we ﬁnish the study of Gauss’s
Method itself in the rest of this chapter.

II Linear Geometry
If you have seen the elements of vectors then this section is an optional
review. However, later work will refer to this material so if this is not a
review then it is not optional.
In the ﬁrst section we had to do a bit of work to show that there are only
three types of solution sets—singleton, empty, and inﬁnite. But this is easy to
see geometrically in the case of systems with two equations and two unknowns.
Draw each two-unknowns equation as a line in the plane and then the two lines
could have a unique intersection, be parallel, or be the same line.

These pictures aren’t a short way to prove the results from the prior section,
because those results apply to linear systems with any number of variables. But
they do provide a visual insight, another way of seeing those results.
This section develops what we need to express our results geometrically. In
particular, while the two-dimensional case is familiar, to extend to systems with
more than two unknowns we shall need some higher-dimensional geometry.
II.1 Vectors in Space
“Higher-dimensional geometry” sounds exotic. It is exotic—interesting and
eye-opening. But it isn’t distant or unreachable.
We begin by deﬁning one-dimensional space to beR. To see that the deﬁnition
is reasonable, picture a one-dimensional space
and pick a point to label0 and another to label1.
0 1
Now, with a scale and a direction, we have a correspondence withR. For instance,
36 Chapter One. Linear Systems
to ﬁnd the point matching+2.17, start at0 and head in the direction of1, and
go2.17 times as far.
The basic idea here, combining magnitude with direction, is the key to
extending to higher dimensions.
An object in anRn that is comprised of a magnitude and a direction is a
vector (we use the same word as in the prior section because we shall show
below how to describe such an object with a column vector). We can draw a
vector as having some length and pointing in some direction.
There is a subtlety involved in the deﬁnition of a vector as consisting of a
magnitude and a direction—these
are equal, even though they start in diﬀerent places They are equal because they
have equal lengths and equal directions. Again: those vectors are not just alike,
they are equal.
How can things that are in diﬀerent places be equal? Think of a vector as
representing a displacement (the word ‘vector’ is Latin for “carrier” or “traveler”).
These two squares undergo displacements that are equal despite that they start
in diﬀerent places.
When we want to emphasize this property vectors have of not being anchored
we refer to them asfree vectors. Thus, these free vectors are equal, as each is a
displacement of one over and two up.
More generally, vectors in the plane are the same if and only if they have the
same change in ﬁrst components and the same change in second components: the
vector extending from (a1,a2) to (b1,b2) equals the vector from (c1,c2) to
(d1,d2) if and only ifb1 −a1 =d1 −c1 andb2 −a2 =d2 −c2.
Saying ‘the vector that, were it to start at(a1,a2), would extend to(b1,b2)’
would be unwieldy. We instead describe that vector as
(
b1 −a1
b2 −a2
)
Section II. Linear Geometry 37
so that we represent the ‘one over and two up’ arrows shown above in this way.
(
1
2
)
We often draw the arrow as starting at the origin, and we then say it is in the
canonical position(or natural positionor standard position). When
⃗v =
(
v1
v2
)
is in canonical position then it extends from the origin to the endpoint(v1,v2).
We will typically say “the point
(
1
2
)
”
rather than “the endpoint of the canonical position of” that vector. Thus, we
will call each of theseR2.
{(x1,x2) |x1,x2∈ R } {
(
x1
x2
)
|x1,x2∈ R }
In the prior section we deﬁned vectors and vector operations with an algebraic
motivation;

) (
v1
v2
)
+
(
w1
w2
)
=
(
v1 +w1
v2 +w2
)
we can now understand those operations geometrically. For instance, if ⃗v
represents a displacement then3⃗v represents a displacement in the same direction
but three times as far and−1⃗v represents a displacement of the same distance
as ⃗v but in the opposite direction.
⃗v
−⃗v
3⃗v
And, where⃗vand ⃗wrepresentdisplacements, ⃗v+⃗wrepresentsthosedisplacements
combined.
⃗v
⃗w
⃗v + ⃗w
38 Chapter One. Linear Systems
The long arrow is the combined displacement in this sense: imagine that you are
walking on a ship’s deck. Suppose that in one minute the ship’s motion gives it
a displacement relative to the sea of⃗v, and in the same minute your walking
gives you a displacement relative to the ship’s deck of⃗w. Then ⃗v + ⃗w is your
displacement relative to the sea.
Another way to understand the vector sum is with theparallelogram rule.
Draw the parallelogram formed by the vectors⃗v and ⃗w. Then the sum⃗v + ⃗w
extends along the diagonal to the far corner.
⃗v + ⃗w
⃗v
⃗w
The above drawings show how vectors and vector operations behave inR2.
We can extend toR3, or to even higher-dimensional spaces where we have no
pictures, with the obvious generalization: the free vector that, if it starts at
(a1,...,a n), ends at(b1,...,b n), is represented by this column.


b1 −a1
...
bn −an


Vectors are equal if they have the same representation. We aren’t too careful
about distinguishing between a point and the vector whose canonical representa-
tion ends at that point.
Rn = {


v1
...
vn

 |v1,...,v n∈ R }
And, we do addition and scalar multiplication component-wise.
Having considered points, we next turn to lines. InR2, the line through
(1,2 ) and (3,1 ) is comprised of (the endpoints of) the vectors in this set.

are described using negative values oft.

and lines in even higher-dimensional spaces work in the same way.
In R3, a line uses one parameter so that a particle on that line would be
free to move back and forth in one dimension. A plane involves two parameters.
For example, the plane through the points(1,0,5 ), (2,1, −3), and (−2,4,0.5 )
consists of (endpoints of) the vectors in this set.

is a three-dimensional linear surface. Again, the intuition is that a line permits
motion in one direction, a plane permits motion in combinations of two directions,
etc. When the dimension of the linear surface is one less than the dimension of
the space, that is, when inRn we have an(n −1)-ﬂat, the surface is called a
hyperplane.
A description of a linear surface can be misleading about the dimension. For

We shall see in the Linear Independence section of Chapter Two what relation-
ships among vectors causes the linear surface they generate to be degenerate.
We now can restate in geometric terms our conclusions from earlier. First,
the solution set of a linear system withn unknowns is a linear surface inRn.
Speciﬁcally, it is ak-dimensional linear surface, wherek is the number of free
variables in an echelon form version of the system. For instance, in the single
equation case the solution set is ann −1-dimensional hyperplane inRn, where
n > 1. Second, the solution set of a homogeneous linear system is a linear
surface passing through the origin. Finally, we can view the general solution
set of any linear system as being the solution set of its associated homogeneous
system oﬀset from the origin by a vector, namely by any particular solution.

1.11 Euclid describes a plane as “a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines
on itself”. Commentators such as Heron have interpreted this to mean, “(A plane
surface is) such that, if a straight line pass through two points on it, the line
coincides wholly with it at every spot, all ways”. (Translations from [Heath], pp.
171-172.) Do planes, as described in this section, have that property? Does this
description adequately deﬁne planes?
II.2 Length and Angle Measures
We’ve translated the ﬁrst section’s results about solution sets into geometric
terms, to better understand those sets. But we must be careful not to be misled
by our own terms—labeling subsets of Rk of the forms {⃗p +t⃗v |t∈ R } and
{⃗p +t⃗v +s⃗w |t,s∈ R } as ‘lines’ and ‘planes’ doesn’t make them act like the
lines and planes of our past experience. Rather, we must ensure that the names
suit the sets. While we can’t prove that the sets satisfy our intuition—we
can’t prove anything about intuition—in this subsection we’ll observe that a
result familiar fromR2 and R3, when generalized to arbitraryRn, supports the
idea that a line is straight and a plane is ﬂat. Speciﬁcally, we’ll see how to do
Euclidean geometry in a ‘plane’ by giving a deﬁnition of the angle between two
Rn vectors, in the plane that they generate.
2.1 DeﬁnitionThe length of a vector⃗v∈ Rn is the square root of the sum of the
squares of its components.
|⃗v | =
√
v2
1 +··· +v2n
2.2 Remark This is a natural generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem. A
classic motivating discussion is in [Polya].
Section II. Linear Geometry 43
For any nonzero⃗v, the vector⃗v/|⃗v| has length one. We say that the second
normalizes ⃗v to length one.
We can use that to get a formula for the angle between two vectors. Consider
two vectors inR3 where neither is a multiple of the other
⃗v
⃗u
(the special case of multiples will turn out below not to be an exception). They
determine a two-dimensional plane—for instance, put them in canonical position
and take the plane formed by the origin and the endpoints. In that plane consider
the triangle with sides⃗u, ⃗v, and ⃗u − ⃗v.
Apply the Law of Cosines:|⃗u − ⃗v |2 = |⃗u |2 + |⃗v |2 −2 |⃗u | |⃗v |cosθ whereθ is the
angle between the vectors. The left side gives
(u1 −v1)2 + (u2 −v2)2 + (u3 −v3)2
= (u2
1 −2u1v1 +v2
1) + (u2
2 −2u2v2 +v2
2) + (u2
3 −2u3v3 +v2
3)
while the right side gives this.
(u2
1 +u2
2 +u2
3) + (v2
1 +v2
2 +v2
3) −2 |⃗u | |⃗v |cosθ
Canceling squaresu2
1, ..., v2
3 and dividing by2 gives a formula for the angle.
θ = arccos(u1v1 +u2v2 +u3v3
|⃗u | |⃗v | )
In higher dimensions we cannot draw pictures as above but we can instead
make the argument analytically. First, the form of the numerator is clear; it
comes from the middle terms of(ui −vi)2.
2.3 DeﬁnitionThe dot product (or inner product or scalar product) of two
n-component real vectors is the linear combination of their components.
⃗u•⃗v =u1v1 +u2v2 +··· +unvn
44 Chapter One. Linear Systems
Note that the dot product of two vectors is a real number, not a vector, and
that the dot product is only deﬁned if the two vectors have the same number
of components. Note also that dot product is related to length: ⃗u• ⃗u =
u1u1 +··· +unun = |⃗u |2.
2.4 Remark Some authors require that the ﬁrst vector be a row vector and that
the second vector be a column vector. We shall not be that strict and will allow
the dot product operation between two column vectors.
Still reasoning analytically but guided by the pictures, we use the next
theorem to argue that the triangle formed by the line segments making the
bodies of ⃗u, ⃗v, and ⃗u + ⃗v in Rn lies in the planar subset ofRn generated by ⃗u
and ⃗v (see the ﬁgure below).
2.5 Theorem (Triangle Inequality) For any⃗u,⃗v∈ Rn,
|⃗u + ⃗v | ⩽ |⃗u | + |⃗v |
with equality if and only if one of the vectors is a nonnegative scalar multiple of
the other one.
This is the source of the familiar saying, “The shortest distance between two
points is in a straight line.”
⃗u
⃗v⃗u + ⃗v
start
ﬁnish
Proof (We’ll use some algebraic properties of dot product that we have not yet
checked, for instance that⃗u•(⃗a + ⃗b) = ⃗u•⃗a + ⃗u•⃗b and that ⃗u•⃗v = ⃗v•⃗u. See
Exercise 18.) Since all the numbers are positive, the inequality holds if and only
if its square holds.
|⃗u + ⃗v |2 ⩽ ( |⃗u | + |⃗v | )2
( ⃗u + ⃗v )•( ⃗u + ⃗v ) ⩽ |⃗u |2 +2 |⃗u | |⃗v | + |⃗v |2
⃗u•⃗u + ⃗u•⃗v + ⃗v•⃗u + ⃗v•⃗v ⩽ ⃗u•⃗u +2 |⃗u | |⃗v | + ⃗v•⃗v
2 ⃗u•⃗v ⩽2 |⃗u | |⃗v |
That, in turn, holds if and only if the relationship obtained by multiplying both
sides by the nonnegative numbers|⃗u | and |⃗v |
2 ( |⃗v | ⃗u )•( |⃗u |⃗v ) ⩽2 |⃗u |2 |⃗v |2
Section II. Linear Geometry 45
and rewriting
0 ⩽ |⃗u |2 |⃗v |2 −2 ( |⃗v | ⃗u )•( |⃗u |⃗v ) + |⃗u |2 |⃗v |2
is true. But factoring shows that it is true
0 ⩽ ( |⃗u |⃗v − |⃗v | ⃗u )•( |⃗u |⃗v − |⃗v | ⃗u )
since it only says that the square of the length of the vector|⃗u |⃗v − |⃗v | ⃗u is not
negative. As for equality, it holds when, and only when,|⃗u |⃗v − |⃗v | ⃗u is ⃗0. The
check that |⃗u |⃗v = |⃗v | ⃗u if and only if one vector is a nonnegative real scalar
multiple of the other is easy. QED
This result supports the intuition that even in higher-dimensional spaces,
lines are straight and planes are ﬂat. We can easily check from the deﬁnition
that linear surfaces have the property that for any two points in that surface,
the line segment between them is contained in that surface. But if the linear
surface were not ﬂat then that would allow for a shortcut.
P Q
Because the Triangle Inequality says that in anyRn the shortest cut between
two endpoints is simply the line segment connecting them, linear surfaces have
no bends.
Back to the deﬁnition of angle measure. The heart of the Triangle Inequality’s
proof is the⃗u•⃗v ⩽ |⃗u | |⃗v | line. We might wonder if some pairs of vectors satisfy
the inequality in this way: while⃗u•⃗v is a large number, with absolute value
bigger than the right-hand side, it is a negative large number. The next result
says that does not happen.
2.6 Corollary (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality) For any⃗u,⃗v∈ Rn,
| ⃗u•⃗v | ⩽ | ⃗u | |⃗v |
with equality if and only if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.
Proof The Triangle Inequality’s proof shows that⃗u•⃗v ⩽ |⃗u | |⃗v | so if ⃗u•⃗v is
positive or zero then we are done. If⃗u•⃗v is negative then this holds.
| ⃗u•⃗v | = −( ⃗u•⃗v ) = (− ⃗u )•⃗v ⩽ |−⃗u | |⃗v | = |⃗u | |⃗v |
The equality condition is Exercise 19. QED
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality assures us that the next deﬁnition makes
sense because the fraction has absolute value less than or equal to one.
46 Chapter One. Linear Systems
2.7 DeﬁnitionThe angle between two nonzero vectors⃗u,⃗v∈ Rn is
θ = arccos( ⃗u•⃗v
|⃗u | |⃗v | )
(if either is the zero vector then we take the angle to be a right angle).
2.8 Corollary Vectors from Rn are orthogonal, that is, perpendicular, if and only
if their dot product is zero. They are parallel if and only if their dot product
equals the product of their lengths.
2.9 Example These vectors are orthogonal.

though theyz-plane may appear to be perpendicular to thexy-plane, in fact
the two planes are that way only in the weak sense that there are vectors in each
orthogonal to all vectors in the other. Not every vector in each is orthogonal to
all vectors in the other.

III Reduced Echelon Form
After developing the mechanics of Gauss’s Method, we observed that it can be
done in more than one way. For example, from this matrix
(

)
we could derive any of these three echelon form matrices.
(
2 2
0 −1
) (
1 1
0 −1
) (
2 0
0 −1
)
The ﬁrst results from−2ρ1 +ρ2. The second comes from doing(1/2)ρ1 and
then −4ρ1 +ρ2. The third comes from−2ρ1 +ρ2 followed by2ρ2 +ρ1 (after the
ﬁrst row combination the matrix is already in echelon form but it is nonetheless
a legal row operation).
In this chapter’s ﬁrst section we noted that this raises questions. Will any two
echelon form versions of a linear system have the same number of free variables?
If yes, will the two have exactly the same free variables? In this section we will
give a way to decide if one linear system can be derived from another by row
operations. The answers to both questions, both “yes,” will follow from that.
III.1 Gauss-Jordan Reduction
Here is an extension of Gauss’s Method that has some advantages.
1.1 Example To solve
x +y −2z = −2
y +3z = 7
x − z = −1
we can start as usual by reducing it to echelon form.

other entries in each column by combining upwards.

The answer isx =1,y =1, andz =2.
Using one entry to clear out the rest of a column ispivoting on that entry.
Notice that the row combination operations in the ﬁrst stage move left to
right while the combination operations in the third stage move right to left.

don’t interact so we can combine multiple ones into a single step.

Jordan reduction.
1.3 DeﬁnitionA matrix or linear system is inreduced echelon formif, in addition
to being in echelon form, each leading entry is a1 and is the only nonzero entry
in its column.
The cost of using Gauss-Jordan reduction to solve a system is the additional
arithmetic. The beneﬁt is that we can just read oﬀ the solution set description.
In any echelon form system, reduced or not, we can read oﬀ when the system
has an empty solution set because there is a contradictory equation. We can
read oﬀ when the system has a one-element solution set because there is no
contradiction and every variable is the leading variable in some row. And, we
can read oﬀ when the system has an inﬁnite solution set because there is no
contradiction and at least one variable is free.
However, in reduced echelon form we can read oﬀ not just the size of the
solution set but also its description. We have no trouble describing the solution
set when it is empty, of course. Example 1.1 and 1.2 show how in a single

next example shows how to read the parametrization of an inﬁnite solution set.

Thus, echelon form isn’t some kind of one best form for systems. Other
forms, such as reduced echelon form, have advantages and disadvantages. Instead
of picturing linear systems (and the associated matrices) as things we operate
on, always directed toward the goal of echelon form, we can think of them as
interrelated, where we can get from one to another by row operations. The rest
of this subsection develops this thought.
1.5 Lemma Elementary row operations are reversible.
Proof For any matrixA, the eﬀect of swapping rows is reversed by swapping
them back, multiplying a row by a nonzerok is undone by multiplying by1/k,
and adding a multiple of rowi to rowj (withi⁄=j) is undone by subtracting
the same multiple of rowi from rowj.

Again, the point of view that we are developing, supported now by the lemma,
is that the term ‘reduces to’ is misleading: whereA−→B, we shouldn’t think
ofB as afterA or simpler thanA. Instead we should think of the two matrices
as interrelated. Below is a picture. It shows the matrices from the start of this
section and their reduced echelon form version in a cluster, as interreducible.

We say that matrices that reduce to each other are equivalent with respect
to the relationship of row reducibility. The next result justiﬁes this, using the
deﬁnition of an equivalence.∗
1.6 Lemma Between matrices, ‘reduces to’ is an equivalence relation.
Proof We must check the conditions (i) reﬂexivity, that any matrix reduces
to itself, (ii) symmetry, that if A reduces to B then B reduces to A, and
(iii) transitivity, that ifA reduces toB andB reduces toC thenA reduces toC.
Reﬂexivity is easy; any matrix reduces to itself in zero-many operations.
The relationship is symmetric by the prior lemma—ifA reduces toB by
some row operations then alsoB reduces toA by reversing those operations.
For transitivity, suppose thatA reduces to B and that B reduces to C.
Following the reduction steps fromA→···→ B with those fromB→···→ C
gives a reduction fromA toC. QED
1.7 DeﬁnitionTwo matrices that are interreducible by elementary row operations
are row equivalent.
The diagram below shows the collection of all matrices as a box. Inside that
box each matrix lies in a class. Matrices are in the same class if and only if they
are interreducible. The classes are disjoint—no matrix is in two distinct classes.
We have partitioned the collection of matrices intorow equivalence classes.†

One of the classes is the cluster of interrelated matrices from the start of this
section sketched above (it includes all of the nonsingular2×2 matrices).
The next subsection proves that the reduced echelon form of a matrix is
unique. Rephrased in terms of the row-equivalence relationship, we shall prove
that every matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon form
matrix. In terms of the partition what we shall prove is: every equivalence class
contains one and only one reduced echelon form matrix. So each reduced echelon
form matrix serves as a representative of its class.

III.2 The Linear Combination Lemma
We will close this chapter by proving that every matrix is row equivalent to one
and only one reduced echelon form matrix. The ideas here will reappear, and be
further developed, in the next chapter.
The crucial observation concerns how row operations act to transform one
matrix into another: the new rows are linear combinations of the old.

linear combinations of the rows.

2.3 Lemma (Linear Combination Lemma) A linear combination of linear combina-
tions is a linear combination.
Proof Given the setc1,1x1 +··· +c1,nxn throughcm,1x1 +··· +cm,nxn of
linear combinations of thex’s, consider a combination of those
d1(c1,1x1 +··· +c1,nxn) +··· + dm(cm,1x1 +··· +cm,nxn)
where thed’s are scalars along with thec’s. Distributing thosed’s and regrouping
gives
= (d1c1,1 +··· +dmcm,1)x1 +··· + (d1c1,n +··· +dmcm,n)xn
which is also a linear combination of thex’s. QED
2.4 Corollary Where one matrix reduces to another, each row of the second is a
linear combination of the rows of the ﬁrst.
Proof For any two interreducible matricesA andB there is some minimum
number of row operations that will take one to the other. We proceed by
induction on that number.
In the base step, that we can go from one matrix to another using zero
reduction operations, the two are equal. Then each row ofB is trivially a
combination ofA’s rows⃗βi =0· ⃗α1 +··· +1· ⃗αi +··· +0· ⃗αm.
For the inductive step assume the inductive hypothesis: withk > 0, any
matrix that can be derived fromA ink or fewer operations has rows that are
linear combinations ofA’s rows. Consider a matrixB such that reducingA toB
requiresk +1 operations. In that reduction there is a next-to-last matrixG, so
thatA−→···−→ G−→B. The inductive hypothesis applies to thisG because
it is onlyk steps away fromA. That is, each row ofG is a linear combination of
the rows ofA.
We will verify that the rows ofB are linear combinations of the rows ofG.
Then the Linear Combination Lemma, Lemma 2.3, applies to show that the
rows ofB are linear combinations of the rows ofA.
If the row operation takingG toB is a swap then the rows ofB are just the
rows ofG reordered and each row ofB is a linear combination of the rows ofG.
If the operation takingG toB is multiplication of a row by a scalarcρi then
⃗βi =c⃗γi and the other rows are unchanged. Finally, if the row operation is
adding a multiple of one row to anotherrρi +ρj then only rowj ofB diﬀers from
the matching row ofG, and ⃗βj =rγi +γj, which is indeed a linear combinations
of the rows ofG.
Because we have proved both a base step and an inductive step, the proposi-
tion follows by the principle of mathematical induction. QED
58 Chapter One. Linear Systems
We now have the insight that Gauss’s Method builds linear combinations
of the rows. But of course its goal is to end in echelon form, since that is a
particularly basic version of a linear system, as it has isolated the variables. For
instance, in this matrix
R =


2 3 7 8 0 0
0 0 1 5 1 1
0 0 0 3 3 0
0 0 0 0 2 1


x1 has been removed fromx5’s equation. That is, Gauss’s Method has made
x5’s row in some way independent ofx1’s row.
The following result makes this intuition precise. We sometimes refer to
Gauss’s Method as Gaussian elimination. What it eliminates is linear relation-
ships among the rows.
2.5 Lemma In an echelon form matrix, no nonzero row is a linear combination
of the other nonzero rows.
Proof Let R be an echelon form matrix and consider its non-⃗0 rows. First
observe that if we have a row written as a combination of the others⃗ρi =
c1⃗ρ1 +··· +ci−1⃗ρi−1 +ci+1⃗ρi+1 +··· +cm⃗ρm then we can rewrite that equation
as
⃗0 =c1⃗ρ1 +··· +ci−1⃗ρi−1 +ci⃗ρi +ci+1⃗ρi+1 +··· +cm⃗ρm (∗)
where not all the coeﬃcients are zero; speciﬁcally,ci = −1. The converse holds
also: given equation (∗) where someci⁄=0 we could express⃗ρi as a combination
of the other rows by movingci⃗ρi to the left and dividing by−ci. Therefore we
will have proved the theorem if we show that in (∗) all of the coeﬃcients are0.
For that we use induction on the row numberi.
The base case is the ﬁrst rowi =1 (if there is no such nonzero row, so that
R is the zero matrix, then the lemma holds vacuously). Let𝓁i be the column
number of the leading entry in rowi. Consider the entry of each row that is in
column𝓁1. Equation (∗) gives this.
0 =c1r1,𝓁1 +c2r2,𝓁1 +··· +cmrm,𝓁1 (∗∗)
The matrix is in echelon form so every row after the ﬁrst has a zero entry in that
columnr2,𝓁1 =··· =rm,𝓁1 =0. Thus equation (∗∗) shows thatc1 =0, because
r1,𝓁1⁄=0 as it leads the row.
The inductive step is much the same as the base step. Again consider
equation (∗). We will prove that if the coeﬃcientci is 0 for each row index
i∈ {1,...,k } thenck+1 is also0. We focus on the entries from column𝓁k+1.
0 =c1r1,𝓁k+1 +··· +ck+1rk+1,𝓁k+1 +··· +cmrm,𝓁k+1
Section III. Reduced Echelon Form 59
By the inductive hypothesisc1, ...ck are all0 so this reduces to the equation
0 = ck+1rk+1,𝓁k+1 +··· +cmrm,𝓁k+1. The matrix is in echelon form so the
entriesrk+2,𝓁k+1, ..., rm,𝓁k+1 are all0. Thusck+1 =0, becauserk+1,𝓁k+1⁄=0
as it is the leading entry. QED
With that, we are ready to show that the end product of Gauss-Jordan
reduction is unique.
2.6 Theorem Each matrix is row equivalent to a unique reduced echelon form
matrix.
Proof [Yuster] Fix a number of rowsm. We will proceed by induction on the
number of columnsn.
The base case is that the matrix hasn =1 column. If this is the zero matrix
then its echelon form is the zero matrix. If instead it has any nonzero entries
then when the matrix is brought to reduced echelon form it must have at least
one nonzero entry, which must be a1 in the ﬁrst row. Either way, its reduced
echelon form is unique.
For the inductive step we assume thatn>1 and that allm row matrices
having fewer thann columns have a unique reduced echelon form. Consider
anm×n matrix A and suppose thatB andC are two reduced echelon form
matrices derived fromA. We will show that these two must be equal.
Let ˆA be the matrix consisting of the ﬁrstn −1 columns ofA. Observe
that any sequence of row operations that bringA to reduced echelon form will
also bring ˆA to reduced echelon form. By the inductive hypothesis this reduced
echelon form ofˆA is unique, so ifB andC diﬀer then the diﬀerence must occur
in columnn.
We ﬁnish the inductive step and the argument by showing that the two
cannot diﬀer only in that column. Consider a homogeneous system of equations
for whichA is the matrix of coeﬃcients.
a1,1x1 + a1,2x2 +··· + a1,nxn = 0
a2,1x1 + a2,2x2 +··· + a2,nxn = 0
...
am,1x1 +am,2x2 +··· +am,nxn = 0
(∗)
By Theorem One.I.1.5 the set of solutions to that system is the same as the set
of solutions toB’s system
b1,1x1 + b1,2x2 +··· + b1,nxn = 0
b2,1x1 + b2,2x2 +··· + b2,nxn = 0
...
bm,1x1 +bm,2x2 +··· +bm,nxn = 0

and toC’s.
c1,1x1 + c1,2x2 +··· + c1,nxn = 0
c2,1x1 + c2,2x2 +··· + c2,nxn = 0
...
cm,1x1 +cm,2x2 +··· +cm,nxn = 0
(∗∗∗)
With B and C diﬀerent only in columnn, suppose that they diﬀer in rowi.
Subtract rowi of (∗∗∗) from rowi of (∗∗) to get the equation(bi,n −ci,n)·xn =0.
We’ve assumed thatbi,n⁄=ci,n and so we getxn =0. Thusxn is not a free
variable and so in (∗∗) and (∗∗∗) then-th column contains the leading entry of
some row, since in an echelon form matrix any column that does not contain a
leading entry is associated with a free variable.
But now, withB andC equal on the ﬁrstn −1 columns, by the deﬁnition of
reduced echeleon form their leading entries in then-th column are in the same
row. And, both leading entries would have to be1, and would have to be the
only nonzero entries in that column. ThereforeB =C. QED
We have asked whether any two echelon form versions of a linear system have
the same number of free variables, and if so are they exactly the same variables?
With the prior result we can answer both questions “yes.” There is no linear
system such that, say, we could apply Gauss’s Method one way and gety andz
free but apply it another way and gety andw free.
Before the proof, recall the distinction between free variables and parameters.
This system
x +y =1
y +z =2
has one free variable,z, because it is the only variable not leading a row. We
have the habit of parametrizing using the free variabley =2 −z,x = −1 +z, but
we could also parametrize using another variable, such asz =2 −y,x =1 −y.
So the set of parameters is not unique, it is the set of free variables that is
unique.
2.7 Corollary If from a starting linear systems we derive by Gauss’s Method two
diﬀerent echelon form systems, then the two have the same free variables.
Proof The prior result says that the reduced echelon form is unique. We get
from any echelon form version to the reduced echelon form by eliminating up, so
any echelon form version of a system has the same free variables as the reduced
echelon form version. QED
We close with a recap. In Gauss’s Method we start with a matrix and then
derive a sequence of other matrices. We deﬁned two matrices to be related if we
Section III. Reduced Echelon Form 61
can derive one from the other. That relation is an equivalence relation, called
row equivalence, and so partitions the set of all matrices into row equivalence
classes.

(There are inﬁnitely many matrices in the pictured class, but we’ve only got
room to show two.) We have proved there is one and only one reduced echelon

representatives of the classes.

The idea here is that one way to understand a mathematical situation is
by being able to classify the cases that can happen. This is a theme in this
book and we have seen this several times already. We classiﬁed solution sets of
linear systems into the no-elements, one-element, and inﬁnitely-many elements
cases. We also classiﬁed linear systems with the same number of equations as
unknowns into the nonsingular and singular cases.
Here, where we are investigating row equivalence, we know that the set of all
matrices breaks into the row equivalence classes and we now have a way to put
our ﬁnger on each of those classes—we can think of the matrices in a class as
derived by row operations from the unique reduced echelon form matrix in that
class.
Put in more operational terms, uniqueness of reduced echelon form lets us
answer questions about the classes by translating them into questions about
the representatives. For instance, as promised in this section’s opening, we now
can decide whether one matrix can be derived from another by row reduction.
We apply the Gauss-Jordan procedure to both and see if they yield the same
reduced echelon form.

Computer Algebra Systems
The linear systems in this chapter are small enough that their solution by hand
is easy. For large systems, including those involving thousands of equations,
we need a computer. There are special purpose programs such as LINPACK
for this. Also popular are general purpose computer algebra systems including
Maple, Mathematica, orMATLAB, andSage.
For example, in the Topic on Networks, we need to solve this.
i0 − i1 − i2 = 0
i1 − i3 − i5 = 0
i2 − i4 + i5 = 0
i3 + i4 −i6 = 0
5i1 +10i3 =10
2i2 +4i4 =10
5i1 −2i2 +50i5 = 0
Doing this by hand would take time and be error-prone. A computer is better.
Here is that system solved withSage. (There are many ways to do this; the
one here has the advantage of simplicity.)
sage: var('i0,i1,i2,i3,i4,i5,i6')
(i0, i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6)

....: 2 *i2+4*i4==10, 5*i1-2*i2+50*i5==0]
sage: solve(network_system, i0,i1,i2,i3,i4,i5,i6)

i4 == (5/3), i5 == 0, i6 == (7/3)]]

and the vector of constants, and then we get the solution.

Input-Output Analysis
An economy is an immensely complicated network of interdependence. Changes
in one part can ripple out to aﬀect other parts. Economists have struggled to
be able to describe, and to make predictions about, such a complicated object.
Mathematical models using systems of linear equations are a key tool. One
example is Input-Output Analysis, pioneered by W. Leontief, who won the 1973
Nobel Prize in Economics.
Consider an economy with many parts, two of which are the steel industry
and the auto industry. These two interact tightly as they work to meet the
demand for their product from other parts of the economy, from users external
to the steel and auto sectors. For instance, should the external demand for autos
go up, that would increase in the auto industry’s usage of steel. Or should the
external demand for steel fall, then it would lower steel’s purchase of trucks.
The model that we consider here takes in the external demands and predicts
how the two interact to meet those demands.
We start with production and consumption statistics. (These numbers,
giving dollar values in millions, are from [Leontief 1965] describing the 1958 U.S.
economy. Today’s statistics would be diﬀerent because of inﬂation and because
of technical changes in the industries.)

steel
used by
auto
used by
others total
value of
steel 5395 2664 25448
value of
auto 48 9030 30346
For instance, the dollar value of steel used by the auto industry in this year is
2,664 million. Note that industries may consume some of their own output.
We can ﬁll in the external demands. This year’s value of the steel used by
others is17,389 and the external value of autos is21,268. With that we have a
complete description of how auto and steel interact to meet their demands.
68 Chapter One. Linear Systems
Now imagine that the external demand for steel has recently been going up
by200 per year and so we estimate that next year it will be17,589. We also
estimate that next year’s external demand for autos will be down25 to21,243.
We wish to predict next year’s total outputs.
That prediction isn’t as simple as adding200 to this year’s steel total and
subtracting 25 from this year’s auto total. For one thing, a rise in steel will
cause that industry to have an increased demand for autos, which will mitigate
the loss in external demand for autos. On the other hand, the drop in external
demand for autos will cause the auto industry to use less steel and so lessen
somewhat the upswing in steel’s business. In short, these two industries form a
system. We must predict where the system as a whole will settle.
Here are the equations.
next year’s production of steel= next year’s use of steel by steel
+next year’s use of steel by auto
+next year’s use of steel by others
next year’s production of autos= next year’s use of autos by steel
+next year’s use of autos by auto
+next year’s use of autos by others
For the left side lets be next years total production of steel and leta be next
year’s total output of autos. For the right side, as discussed above, our external
demand estimates are17,589 and21,243.
For next year’s use of steel by steel, note that this year the steel industry
used5,395 units of steel input to produce25,448 units of steel output. So next
year, when the steel industry will produces units out, we guess that doing so
will takes· (5395 )/(25448 ) units of steel input—this is simply the assumption
that input is proportional to output. (We are assuming that the ratio of input to
output remains constant over time; in practice, models may try to take account
of trends of change in the ratios.)
Next year’s use of steel by the auto industry is similar. This year the auto
industry uses2,664 units of steel input to produce30,346 units of auto output.
So next year, when the auto industry’s total output isa, we expect it to consume
a· (2664 )/(30346 ) units of steel.
Filling in the other equation in the same way gives this system of linear
equations.
(5395/25448 )·s + (2664/30346 )·a +17589 =s
(48/25448 )·s + (9030/30346 )·a +21243 =a
Moving the variables to one side and the constants to the other
(20053/25448 )s − ( 2664/30346 )a =17589
−(48/25448 )s + (21316/30346 )a =21243

sage: solve(eqns, s, a)

sage: n(6476293881123/213660938)
30311.0804517904
gives our prediction:s =25,698 anda =30,311.
Above, we discussed that the prediction of next year’s totals isn’t as simple
as adding200 to last year’s steel total and subtracting25 from last year’s auto
total. Comparing these predictions to the numbers for the current year shows
that the total production of the steel industry should rise by250 while auto’s
total drops by35. The increase in external demand for steel causes an increase
in internal demand by the steel industry, which is lessened somewhat by the
drop in autos, but results in a total that is more than200 higher. Similarly,
auto’s total drops more than25 despite the help that it gets from steel.
One of the advantages of having a mathematical model is that we can ask
“What if ...?” questions. For instance, we can ask, “What if our estimates for
next year’s external demands are somewhat oﬀ?” To try to understand how
much the model’s predictions change in reaction to changes in our estimates,
we can revise the estimate of next year’s external steel demand from17,589
down to17,489, while keeping the assumption of next year’s external demand
for autos ﬁxed at21,243. The resulting system
(20053/25448 )s − ( 2664/30346 )a =17489
−(48/25448 )s + (21316/30346 )a =21243
givess =25,571 anda =30,311. This issensitivity analysis. We are seeing
how sensitive the predictions of our model are to the accuracy of the assumptions.
Naturally, we can consider larger models that detail the interactions among
more sectors of an economy; these models are typically solved on a computer.
Naturally also, a single model does not suit every case and assuring that the
assumptions underlying a model are reasonable for a particular prediction
requires the judgments of experts. With those caveats however, this model has
proven in practice to be a useful and accurate tool for economic analysis. For
further reading, try [Leontief 1951] and [Leontief 1965].

1 With the steel-auto system given above, estimate next year’s total productions in
these cases.
(a) Next year’s external demands are up200 from this year for steel and are

(b) Next year’s external demands are up100 for steel and are up200 for autos.
(c) Next year’s external demands are up200 for steel and are up200 for autos.
2 For the steel-auto system, with the external demand estimates of17,589 and
21,243 discussed above, what will be the value of steel used by steel, the value of
steel used by auto, etc.?
3 In the steel-auto system, the ratio for the use of steel by the auto industry is

Accuracy of Computations
Gauss’s Method lends itself to computerization. The code below illustrates. It
operates on ann×n matrix nameda, doing row combinations using the ﬁrst
row, then the second row, etc.
for(row=1; row<=n-1; row++){
for(row_below=row+1; row_below<=n; row_below++){
multiplier=a[row_below,row]/a[row,row];
for(col=row; col<=n; col++){
a[row_below,col]-=multiplier*a[row,col];
}
}
}
This is in the C language. Thefor(row=1; row<=n-1; row++){ .. } loop initial-
izes row at 1 and then iterates whilerow is less than or equal ton −1, each
time through incrementingrow by one with the++ operation. The other non-
obvious language construct is that the-= in the innermost loop has the eﬀect of
a[row_below,col]=-1*multiplier*a[row,col]+a[row_below,col].
While that code is a ﬁrst take on mechanizing Gauss’s Method, it is naive.
For one thing, it assumes that the entry in therow,row position is nonzero. So
one way that it needs to be extended is to cover the case where ﬁnding a zero
in that location leads to a row swap or to the conclusion that the matrix is
singular.
We could add someif statements to cover those cases but we will instead
consider another way in which this code is naive. It is prone to pitfalls arising
from the computer’s reliance on ﬂoating point arithmetic.
For example, above we have seen that we must handle a singular system as a
separate case. But systems that are nearly singular also require care. Consider
this one (the extra digits are in the ninth signiﬁcant place).
x +2y =3
1.00000001x +2y =3.00000001 (∗)
By eye we easily spot the solutionx =1,y =1. A computer has more trouble. If
it represents real numbers to eight signiﬁcant places, calledsingle precision, then
Topic: Accuracy of Computations 73
it will represent the second equation internally as1.0000000x +2y =3.0000000 ,
losing the digits in the ninth place. Instead of reporting the correct solution,
this computer will think that the two equations are equal and it will report that
the system is singular.
For some intuition about how the computer could come up with something
that far oﬀ, consider this graph of the system.
(1,1 )
We cannot tell the two lines apart; this system is nearly singular in the sense that
the two lines are nearly the same line. This gives the system (∗) the property
that a small change in an equation can cause a large change in the solution. For
instance, changing the3.00000001 to3.00000003 changes the intersection point
from (1,1 ) to (3,0 ). The solution changes radically depending on the ninth digit,
which explains why an eight-place computer has trouble. A problem that is very
sensitive to inaccuracy or uncertainties in the input values isill-conditioned.
The above example gives one way in which a system can be diﬃcult to
solve on a computer. It has the advantage that the picture of nearly-equal lines
gives a memorable insight into one way for numerical diﬃculties to happen.
Unfortunately this insight isn’t useful when we wish to solve some large system.
We typically will not understand the geometry of an arbitrary large system.
There are other ways that a computer’s results may be unreliable, besides
that the angle between some of the linear surfaces is small. For example, consider
this system (from [Hamming]).
0.001x +y =1
x −y =0 (∗∗)
The second equation givesx =y, sox =y =1/1.001 and thus both variables
have values that are just less than1. A computer using two digits represents
the system internally in this way (we will do this example in two-digit ﬂoating
point arithmetic for clarity but inventing a similar one with eight or more digits
is easy).
(1.0×10−3)·x + (1.0×100)·y =1.0×100
(1.0×100)·x − (1.0×100)·y =0.0×100
The row reduction step−1000ρ1 +ρ2 produces a second equation−1001y =
−1000, which this computer rounds to two places as(−1.0×103)y = −1.0×103.
74 Chapter One. Linear Systems
The computer decides from the second equation thaty =1 and with that it
concludes from the ﬁrst equation thatx =0. They value is close but thex is
bad—the ratio of the actual answer to the computer’s answer is inﬁnite. In
short, another cause of unreliable output is the computer’s reliance on ﬂoating
point arithmetic when the system-solving code leads to using leading entries
that are small.
An experienced programmer may respond by usingdouble precision, which
retains sixteen signiﬁcant digits, or perhaps using some even larger size. This
will indeed solve many problems. However, double precision has greater memory
requirements and besides we can obviously tweak the above to give the same
trouble in the seventeenth digit, so double precision isn’t a panacea. We need a
strategy to minimize numerical trouble as well as some guidance about how far
we can trust the reported solutions.
A basic improvement on the naive code above is to not determine the factor
to use for row combinations by simply taking the entry in therow,row position,
but rather to look at all of the entries in therow column below therow,row entry
and take one that is likely to give reliable results because it is not too small.
This ispartial pivoting.
For example, to solve the troublesome system (∗∗) above we start by looking
at both equations for a best entry to use, and take the1 in the second equation
as more likely to give good results. The combination step of−.001ρ2 +ρ1
gives a ﬁrst equation of1.001y = 1, which the computer will represent as
(1.0×100)y =1.0×100, leading to the conclusion thaty =1 and, after back-
substitution, thatx =1, both of which are close to right. We can adapt the
code from above to do this.
for(row=1; row<=n-1; row++){
/* find the largest entry in this column (in row max) */
max=row;
for(row_below=row+1; row_below<=n; row_below++){
if (abs(a[row_below,row]) > abs(a[max,row]));
max = row_below;
}
/* swap rows to move that best entry up */
for(col=row; col<=n; col++){
temp=a[row,col];
a[row,col]=a[max,col];
a[max,col]=temp;
}
/* proceed as before */
for(row_below=row+1; row_below<=n; row_below++){
multiplier=a[row_below,row]/a[row,row];
for(col=row; col<=n; col++){
a[row_below,col]-=multiplier*a[row,col];
}
}
}
A full analysis of the best way to implement Gauss’s Method is beyond the
scope of this book (see [Wilkinson 1965]), but the method recommended by
Topic: Accuracy of Computations 75
most experts ﬁrst ﬁnds the best entry among the candidates and then scales it
to a number that is less likely to give trouble. This isscaled partial pivoting.
In addition to returning a result that is likely to be reliable, most well-done
code will return aconditioning number that describes the factor by which
uncertainties in the input numbers could be magniﬁed to become inaccuracies
in the results returned (see [Rice]).
The lesson is that just because Gauss’s Method always works in theory, and
just because computer code correctly implements that method, doesn’t mean
that the answer is reliable. In practice, always use a package where experts have
worked hard to counter what can go wrong.

(a) Show that the machine will compute(2/3) + ((2/3) − (1/3)) as unequal to

5 Ill-conditioning is not only dependent on the matrix of coeﬃcients. This example
[Hamming] shows that it can arise from an interaction between the left and right

2x +2εy +2εz =2 +4ε
x +2εy − εz = 1 +ε

an exact cancellation of the integer parts on the right side as well as on the left.
(b) Solve the system by hand, rounding to two decimal places, and withε =0.001.

The designer of such a network needs to answer questions such as: how much
electricity ﬂows when both the hi-beam headlights and the brake lights are on?
We will use linear systems to analyze simple electrical networks.
For the analysis we need two facts about electricity and two facts about
electrical networks.
The ﬁrst fact is that a battery is like a pump, providing a force impelling
the electricity to ﬂow, if there is a path. We say that the battery provides a
potential. For instance, when the driver steps on the brake then the switch
makes contact and so makes a circuit on the left side of the diagram, which
includes the brake lights. Once the circuit exists, the battery’s force creates a
ﬂow through that circuit, called acurrent, lighting the lights.
The second electrical fact is that in some kinds of network components the
amount of ﬂow is proportional to the force provided by the battery. That is, for
each such component there is a number, itsresistance, such that the potential
Topic: Analyzing Networks 77
is equal to the ﬂow times the resistance. Potential is measured involts, the
rate of ﬂow is inamperes, and resistance to the ﬂow is inohms; these units are
deﬁned so that volts= amperes·ohms.
Components with this property, that the voltage-amperage response curve is
a line through the origin, areresistors. (Not every component has this property.
For instance, as the light bulbs shown above heat up, their ohmage changes.) An
example is that if a resistor measures2 ohms then wiring it to a12 volt battery
results in a ﬂow of6 amperes. Conversely, if electrical current of2 amperes ﬂows
through that resistor then there must be a4 volt potential diﬀerence between
its ends. This is thevoltage dropacross the resistor. One way to think of the
electrical circuits that we consider here is that the battery provides a voltage
rise while the other components are voltage drops.
The facts that we need about networks areKirchoﬀ’s Current Law, that for
any point in a network the ﬂow in equals the ﬂow out andKirchoﬀ’s Voltage
Law, that around any circuit the total drop equals the total rise.
We start with the network below. It has a battery that provides the potential
to ﬂow and three resistors, shown as zig-zags. When components are wired one
after another, as here, they are inseries.
20 volt

2 ohm
resistance 5 ohm

By Kirchoﬀ’s Voltage Law, because the voltage rise is20 volts, the total voltage
drop must also be20 volts. Since the resistance from start to ﬁnish is10 ohms
(the resistance of the wire connecting the components is negligible), the current
is (20/10) =2 amperes. Now, by Kirchhoﬀ’s Current Law, there are2 amperes
through each resistor. Therefore the voltage drops are:4 volts across the2 ohm
resistor,10 volts across the5 ohm resistor, and6 volts across the3 ohm resistor.
The prior network is simple enough that we didn’t use a linear system but
the next one is more complicated. Here the resistors are inparallel.
20 volt 12 ohm 8 ohm
We begin by labeling the branches as below. Let the current through the left
branch of the parallel portion bei1 and that through the right branch bei2,
78 Chapter One. Linear Systems
and also let the current through the battery bei0. Note that we don’t need to
know the actual direction of ﬂow—if current ﬂows in the direction opposite to
our arrow then we will get a negative number in the solution.
↑i0 i1↓ ↓ i2
The Current Law, applied to the split point in the upper right, gives that
i0 = i1 +i2. Applied to the split point lower right it givesi1 +i2 = i0. In
the circuit that loops out of the top of the battery, down the left branch of the
parallel portion, and back into the bottom of the battery, the voltage rise is
20 while the voltage drop isi1·12, so the Voltage Law gives that12i1 =20.
Similarly, the circuit from the battery to the right branch and back to the
battery gives that8i2 =20. And, in the circuit that simply loops around in the
left and right branches of the parallel portion (we arbitrarily take the direction
of clockwise), there is a voltage rise of0 and a voltage drop of8i2 −12i1 so
8i2 −12i1 =0.
i0 − i1 − i2 = 0
−i0 + i1 + i2 = 0
12i1 =20
8i2 =20
−12i1 +8i2 = 0
The solution isi0 =25/6,i1 =5/3, andi2 =5/2, all in amperes. (Incidentally,
this illustrates that redundant equations can arise in practice.)
Kirchhoﬀ’s laws can establish the electrical properties of very complex net-
works. The next diagram shows ﬁve resistors, whose values are in ohms, wired
in series-parallel.

Kirchhoﬀ’s Current Law, applied to the top node, the left node, the right node,
and the bottom node gives these.
i0 =i1 +i2
i1 =i3 +i5
i2 +i5 =i4
i3 +i4 =i0
Kirchhoﬀ’s Voltage Law, applied to the inside loop (thei0 toi1 toi3 toi0 loop),
the outside loop, and the upper loop not involving the battery, gives these.
5i1 +10i3 =10
2i2 +4i4 =10

Those suﬃce to determine the solutioni0 =7/3,i1 =2/3,i2 =5/3,i3 =2/3,
i4 =5/3, andi5 =0.
We can understand many kinds of networks in this way. For instance, the
exercises analyze some networks of streets.

which is why there is no ‘into Jay’ entry in the table. Note also that over a long
period of time, the total in must approximately equal the total out, which is why
both rows add to235 cars.) Once inside the network, the traﬃc may ﬂow in diﬀerent

least one free variable.)

Chapter T wo
Vector Spaces
The ﬁrst chapter ﬁnished with a fair understanding of how Gauss’s Method
solves a linear system. It systematically takes linear combinations of the rows.
Here we move to a general study of linear combinations.
We need a setting. At times in the ﬁrst chapter we’ve combined vectors from
R2, at other times vectors fromR3, and at other times vectors from higher-
dimensional spaces. So our ﬁrst impulse might be to work inRn, leavingn
unspeciﬁed. This would have the advantage that any of the results would hold
for R2 and for R3 and for many other spaces, simultaneously.
But if having the results apply to many spaces at once is advantageous then
sticking only toRn’s is restrictive. We’d like our results to apply to combinations
of row vectors, as in the ﬁnal section of the ﬁrst chapter. We’ve even seen some
spaces that are not simply a collection of all of the same-sized column vectors or
row vectors. For instance, we’ve seen a homogeneous system’s solution set that
is a plane inside ofR3. This set is a closed system in that a linear combination
of these solutions is also a solution. But it does not contain all of the three-tall
column vectors, only some of them.
We want the results about linear combinations to apply anywhere that linear
combinations make sense. We shall call any such set avector space. Our results,
instead of being phrased as “Whenever we have a collection in which we can
sensibly take linear combinations ...”, will be stated “In any vector space ...”
Such a statement describes at once what happens in many spaces. To
understand the advantages of moving from studying a single space to studying
a class of spaces, consider this analogy. Imagine that the government made
laws one person at a time: “Leslie Jones can’t jay walk.” That would be bad;
statements have the virtue of economy when they apply to many cases at once.
Or suppose that they said, “Kim Ke must stop when passing an accident.”
Contrast that with, “Any doctor must stop when passing an accident.” More
general statements, in some ways, are clearer.
84 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
I Deﬁnition of Vector Space
We shall study structures with two operations, an addition and a scalar multi-
plication, that are subject to some simple conditions. We will reﬂect more on
the conditions later but on ﬁrst reading notice how reasonable they are. For
instance, surely any operation that can be called an addition (e.g., column vector
addition, row vector addition, or real number addition) will satisfy conditions
(1) through (5) below.
I.1 Deﬁnition and Examples
1.1 Deﬁnition A vector space (over R) consists of a set V along with two
operations ‘+’ and ‘·’ subject to the conditions that for all vectors⃗v, ⃗w, ⃗u∈V
and allscalarsr,s∈ R:
(1) the setV is closed under vector addition, that is,⃗v + ⃗w∈V
(2) vector addition is commutative,⃗v + ⃗w = ⃗w + ⃗v
(3) vector addition is associative,(⃗v + ⃗w) + ⃗u = ⃗v + ( ⃗w + ⃗u)
(4) there is azero vector⃗0∈V such that⃗v + ⃗0 = ⃗v for all⃗v∈V
(5) each ⃗v∈V has anadditive inverse ⃗w∈V such that ⃗w + ⃗v = ⃗0
(6) the setV is closed under scalar multiplication, that is,r· ⃗v∈V
(7) scalar multiplication distributes over scalar addition,(r +s)·⃗v =r·⃗v +s·⃗v
(8) scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition,r·(⃗v+ ⃗w) =r·⃗v+r· ⃗w
(9) ordinary multiplication of scalars associates with scalar multiplication,
(rs)· ⃗v =r· (s· ⃗v)
(10) multiplication by the scalar1 is the identity operation,1· ⃗v = ⃗v.
1.2 Remark The deﬁnition involves two kinds of addition and two kinds of
multiplication, and so may at ﬁrst seem confused. For instance, in condition (7)
the ‘+’ on the left is addition of two real numbers while the ‘+’ on the right
is addition of two vectors inV. These expressions aren’t ambiguous because
of context; for example,r and s are real numbers so ‘r +s’ can only mean
real number addition. In the same way, item (9)’s left side ‘rs’ is ordinary real
number multiplication, while its right side ‘s· ⃗v’ is the scalar multiplication
deﬁned for this vector space.
The best way to understand the deﬁnition is to go through the examples below
and for each, check all ten conditions. The ﬁrst example includes that check,
written out at length. Use it as a model for the others. Especially important are
the closure conditions, (1) and (6). They specify that the addition and scalar
Section I. Deﬁnition of Vector Space 85
multiplication operations are always sensible—they are deﬁned for every pair of
vectors and every scalar and vector, and the result of the operation is a member
of the set.
1.3 Example This subset ofR2 is a line through the origin.
L = {
(
x
y
)
|y =3x }
We shall verify that it is a vector space under the usual meaning of ‘+’ and ‘·’.

y2

=

x1 +x2

)
r·

=

)
These operations are just the ordinary ones, reused on its subsetL. We say that
L inherits these operations fromR2.
We shall check all ten conditions. The paragraph having to do with addition
has ﬁve conditions. For condition (1), closure under addition, suppose that we
start with two vectors from the lineL,
⃗v1 =
(
x1
y1
)
⃗v2 =
(
x2
y2
)
so that they satisfy the restrictions thaty1 =3x1 andy2 =3x2. Their sum
⃗v1 + ⃗v2 =
(
x1 +x2
y1 +y2
)
is also a member of the lineL because the fact that its second component is
three times its ﬁrsty1 +y2 =3(x1 +x2) follows from the restrictions on⃗v1
and ⃗v2. For (2), that addition of vectors commutes, just compare
⃗v1 + ⃗v2 =
(
x1 +x2
y1 +y2
)
⃗v2 + ⃗v1 =
(
x2 +x1
y2 +y1
)
and note that they are equal since their entries are real numbers and real numbers
commute. (That the vectors satisfy the restriction of lying in the line is not
relevant for this condition; they commute just because all vectors in the plane
commute.) Condition (3), associativity of vector addition, is similar.

86 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
For the fourth condition we must produce a vector that acts as the zero element.
The vector of zero entries will do.

(

Note that⃗0∈L as its second component is triple its ﬁrst. For (5), that given
any ⃗v∈L we can produce an additive inverse, we have
(

and so the vector−⃗v is the desired inverse. As with the prior condition, observe
here that if⃗v∈L, so thaty =3x, then −⃗v∈L also, since −y =3(−x).
The checks for the ﬁve conditions having to do with scalar multiplication
are similar. For (6), closure under scalar multiplication, suppose thatr∈ R and
⃗v∈L, that is,
⃗v =
(
x

)
satisﬁes thaty =3x. Then
r· ⃗v =r·

(

)
+
(

)
=
(
x1 +x2

)
is a column array with two real entries, and so is a member of the planeR2. In
contrast with the prior example, here there is no restriction on the ﬁrst and
second components of the vectors.
Condition (6) is similar. The vector
r·
(
x
y
)
=
(
rx
ry
)
has two real entries, and so is a member ofR2.
In a similar way, eachRn is a vector space with the usual operations of vector
addition and scalar multiplication. (InR1, we usually do not write the members
as column vectors, i.e., we usually do not write ‘(π)’. Instead we just write ‘π’.)
1.5 Example Example 1.3 gives a subset ofR2 that is a vector space. For contrast,
consider the set of two-tall columns with entries that are integers, under the
same operations of component-wise addition and scalar multiplication. This
is a subset of R2 but it is not a vector space: it is not closed under scalar
multiplication, that is, it does not satisfy condition (6). For instance, on the left
below is a vector with integer entries, and a scalar.

that it inherits fromR4.
A vector space must have at least one element, its zero vector. Thus a
one-element vector space is the smallest possible.
1.7 DeﬁnitionA one-element vector space is atrivial space.
The examples so far involve sets of column vectors with the usual operations.
But vector spaces need not be collections of column vectors, or even of row
vectors. Below are some other types of vector spaces. The term ‘vector space’
does not mean ‘collection of columns of reals’. It means something more like
‘collection in which any linear combination is sensible’.
1.8 Example Consider P3 = {a0 +a1x +a2x2 +a3x3 |a0,...,a 3∈ R }, the set
of polynomials of degree three or less (in this book, we’ll take constant polyno-
mials, including the zero polynomial, to be of degree zero). It is a vector space
under the operations
(a0 +a1x +a2x2 +a3x3) + (b0 +b1x +b2x2 +b3x3)
= (a0 +b0) + (a1 +b1)x + (a2 +b2)x2 + (a3 +b3)x3
and
r· (a0 +a1x +a2x2 +a3x3) = (ra0) + (ra1)x + (ra2)x2 + (ra3)x3
(the veriﬁcation is easy). This vector space is worthy of attention because these
are the polynomial operations familiar from high school algebra. For instance,
3· (1 −2x +3x2 −4x3) −2· (2 −3x +x2 − (1/2)x3) = −1 +7x2 −11x3.
Although this space is not a subset of anyRn, there is a sense in which we
can think ofP3 as “the same” asR4. If we identify these two space’s elements in
this way
a0 +a1x +a2x2 +a3x3 corresponds to


a0
a1



Section I. Deﬁnition of Vector Space 89
then the operations also correspond. Here is an example of corresponding
additions.
1 −2x +0x2 +1x3
+ 2 +3x +7x2 −4x3
3 +1x +7x2 −3x3


Things we are thinking of as “the same” add to “the same” sum. Chapter Three
makes precise this idea of vector space correspondence. For now we shall just
leave it as an intuition.
In general we writePn for the vector space of polynomials of degreen or
less {a0 +a1x +a2x2 +··· +anxn |a0,...,a n∈ R }, under the operations of
the usual polynomial addition and scalar multiplication. We will often use these
spaces as examples.

space under the natural entry-by-entry operations.

As in the prior example, we can think of this space as “the same” asR4.
We write Mn×m for the vector space ofn×m matrices under the natural
operations of matrix addition and scalar multiplication. As with the polynomial
spaces, we will often use these as examples.
1.10 Example The set {f |f : N→ R } of all real-valued functions of one natural
number variable is a vector space under the operations
(f1 +f2) (n) =f1(n) +f2(n) ( r·f) (n) =rf (n)
so that if, for example,f1(n) = n2 +2sin(n) andf2(n) = − sin(n) +0.5 then
(f1 +2f2) (n) =n2 +1.
We can view this space as a generalization of Example 1.4—instead of2-tall
vectors, these functions are like inﬁnitely-tall vectors.

Addition and scalar multiplication are component-wise, as in Example 1.4. (We
can formalize “inﬁnitely-tall” by saying that it means an inﬁnite sequence, or
that it means a function fromN to R.)
1.11 Example The set of polynomials with real coeﬃcients
{a0 +a1x +··· +anxn |n∈ N anda0,...,a n∈ R }
makes a vector space when given the natural ‘+’
(a0 +a1x +··· +anxn) + (b0 +b1x +··· +bnxn)
= (a0 +b0) + (a1 +b1)x +··· + (an +bn)xn
and ‘·’.
r· (a0 +a1x +...a nxn) = (ra0) + (ra1)x +... (ran)xn
This space diﬀers from the spaceP3 of Example 1.8. This space contains
not just degree three polynomials, but degree thirty polynomials and degree
three hundred polynomials, too. Each individual polynomial of course is of a
ﬁnite degree, but the set has no single bound on the degree of all of its members.
We can think of this example, like the prior one, in terms of inﬁnite-tuples.
For instance, we can think of1 +3x +5x2 as corresponding to(1,3,5,0,0,... ).
However, this space diﬀers from the one in Example 1.10. Here, each member of
the set has a ﬁnite degree, that is, under the correspondence there is no element
from this space matching(1,2,5,10,... ). Vectors in this space correspond to
inﬁnite-tuples that end in zeroes.
1.12 Example The set {f |f : R→ R } of all real-valued functions of one real
variable is a vector space under these.
(f1 +f2) (x) =f1(x) +f2(x) ( r·f) (x) =rf (x)
The diﬀerence between this and Example 1.10 is the domain of the functions.
1.13 Example The setF = {acosθ +bsinθ |a,b∈ R} of real-valued functions of
the real variableθ is a vector space under the operations
(a1cosθ +b1sinθ) + (a2cosθ +b2sinθ) = (a1 +a2)cosθ + (b1 +b2)sinθ
and
r· (acosθ +bsinθ) = (ra)cosθ + (rb)sinθ
inherited from the space in the prior example. (We can think ofF as “the same”
as R2 in thatacosθ +bsinθ corresponds to the vector with componentsa and
b.)
Section I. Deﬁnition of Vector Space 91
1.14 Example The set
{f : R→ R | d2f
dx2 +f =0 }
is a vector space under the, by now natural, interpretation.
(f +g) (x) =f(x) +g(x) ( r·f) (x) =rf (x)
In particular, notice that basic Calculus gives
d2(f +g)
dx2 + (f +g) = (d2f
dx2 +f) + (d2g
dx2 +g)
and
d2(rf)
dx2 + (rf) =r(d2f
dx2 +f)
and so the space is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. This
turns out to equal the space from the prior example—functions satisfying
this diﬀerential equation have the formacosθ +bsinθ—but this description
suggests an extension to solutions sets of other diﬀerential equations.
1.15 Example The set of solutions of a homogeneous linear system inn variables is
a vector space under the operations inherited fromRn. For example, for closure
under addition consider a typical equation in that systemc1x1 +··· +cnxn =0
and suppose that both these vectors
⃗v =


v1
...
vn

 ⃗w =


w1
...
wn


satisfy the equation. Then their sum⃗v + ⃗w also satisﬁes that equation:c1(v1 +
w1) +··· +cn(vn +wn) = (c1v1 +··· +cnvn) + (c1w1 +··· +cnwn) =0. The
checks of the other vector space conditions are just as routine.
We often omit the multiplication symbol ‘·’ between the scalar and the vector.
We distinguish the multiplication inc1v1 from that inr⃗v by context, since if
both multiplicands are real numbers then it must be real-real multiplication
while if one is a vector then it must be scalar-vector multiplication.
Example 1.15 has brought us full circle since it is one of our motivating
examples. Now, with some feel for the kinds of structures that satisfy the
deﬁnition of a vector space, we can reﬂect on that deﬁnition. For example, why
specify in the deﬁnition the condition that1· ⃗v = ⃗v but not a condition that
0· ⃗v = ⃗0?
One answer is that this is just a deﬁnition—it gives the rules and you need
to follow those rules to continue.
92 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
Another answer is perhaps more satisfying. People in this area have worked
to develop the right balance of power and generality. This deﬁnition is shaped
so that it contains the conditions needed to prove all of the interesting and
important properties of spaces of linear combinations. As we proceed, we shall
derive all of the properties natural to collections of linear combinations from the
conditions given in the deﬁnition.
The next result is an example. We do not need to include these properties
in the deﬁnition of vector space because they follow from the properties already
listed there.
1.16 Lemma In any vector spaceV, for any⃗v∈V andr∈ R, we have (1)0·⃗v = ⃗0,
(2) (−1· ⃗v) + ⃗v = ⃗0, and (3)r· ⃗0 = ⃗0.
Proof For (1) note that⃗v = (1 +0)· ⃗v = ⃗v + (0· ⃗v). Add to both sides the
additive inverse of⃗v, the vector⃗w such that ⃗w + ⃗v = ⃗0.
⃗w + ⃗v = ⃗w + ⃗v +0· ⃗v
⃗0 = ⃗0 +0· ⃗v
⃗0 =0· ⃗v
Item (2) is easy:(−1·⃗v) +⃗v = (−1 +1)·⃗v =0·⃗v = ⃗0. For (3),r·⃗0 =r· (0·⃗0) =
(r·0)· ⃗0 = ⃗0 will do. QED
The second item shows that we can write the additive inverse of⃗v as ‘−⃗v’
without worrying about any confusion with(−1)· ⃗v.
A recap: our study in Chapter One of Gaussian reduction led us to consider
collections of linear combinations. So in this chapter we have deﬁned a vector
space to be a structure in which we can form such combinations, subject to
simple conditions on the addition and scalar multiplication operations. In a
phrase: vector spaces are the right context in which to study linearity.
From the fact that it forms a whole chapter, and especially because that
chapter is the ﬁrst one, a reader could suppose that our purpose in this book is
the study of linear systems. The truth is that we will not so much use vector
spaces in the study of linear systems as we instead have linear systems start us
on the study of vector spaces. The wide variety of examples from this subsection
shows that the study of vector spaces is interesting and important in its own
right. Linear systems won’t go away. But from now on our primary objects of
study will be vector spaces.

((⃗v1 + ⃗v2) + ⃗v3) + ⃗v4 = (⃗v1 + (⃗v2 + ⃗v3)) + ⃗v4 = (⃗v1 + ⃗v2) + (⃗v3 + ⃗v4)
= ⃗v1 + ((⃗v2 + ⃗v3) + ⃗v4) = ⃗v1 + (⃗v2 + (⃗v3 + ⃗v4))
This allows us to write ‘⃗v1 + ⃗v2 + ⃗v3 + ⃗v4’ without ambiguity.
(b) Prove that any two ways of associating a sum of any number of vectors give
the same sum. (Hint. Use induction on the number of vectors.)
1.45 Example 1.5 gives a subset ofR2 that is not a vector space, under the obvious
operations, because while it is closed under addition, it is not closed under scalar
multiplication. Consider the set of vectors in the plane whose components have
the same sign or are0. Show that this set is closed under scalar multiplication but
not addition.
I.2 Subspaces and Spanning Sets
In Example 1.3 we saw a vector space that is a subset ofR2, a line through the
origin. There, the vector spaceR2 contains inside it another vector space, the
line.
2.1 DeﬁnitionFor any vector space, asubspace is a subset that is itself a vector
space, under the inherited operations.
2.2 Example This plane through the origin
P = {


x
y
z

 |x +y +z =0 }
is a subspace ofR3. As required by the deﬁnition the plane’s operations are
inherited from the larger space, that is, vectors add inP as they add inR3


x1
y1
z1

 +


x2
y2
z2

 =


x1 +x2
y1 +y2
z1 +z2


Section I. Deﬁnition of Vector Space 97
and scalar multiplication is also the same as in R3. To show that P is a
subspace we need only note that it is a subset and then verify that it is a
space. We won’t check all ten conditions, just the two closure ones. For closure
under addition, note that if the summands satisfy thatx1 +y1 +z1 =0 and
x2 +y2 +z2 =0 then the sum satisﬁes that(x1 +x2) + (y1 +y2) + (z1 +z2) =
(x1 +y1 +z1) + (x2 +y2 +z2) =0. For closure under scalar multiplication, if
x +y +z =0 then the scalar multiple hasrx +ry +rz =r(x +y +z) =0.
2.3 Example The x-axis in R2 is a subspace, where the addition and scalar
multiplication operations are the inherited ones.

x2

)
=
(
x1 +x2

)
r·

)
As in the prior example, to verify directly from the deﬁnition that this is a
subspace we simply note that it is a subset and then check that it satisﬁes the
conditions in deﬁnition of a vector space. For instance the two closure conditions
are satisﬁed: adding two vectors with a second component of zero results in a
vector with a second component of zero and multiplying a scalar times a vector
with a second component of zero results in a vector with a second component of
zero.
2.4 Example Another subspace ofR2 is its trivial subspace.
{
(
0
0
)
}
Any vector space has a trivial subspace{⃗0 }. At the opposite extreme, any
vector space has itself for a subspace. A subspace that is not the entire space is
a proper subspace.
2.5 Example Vector spaces that are notRn’s also have subspaces. The space of
cubic polynomials{a +bx +cx2 +dx3 |a,b,c,d ∈ R }has a subspace comprised
of all linear polynomials{m +nx |m,n∈ R }.
2.6 Example Another example of a subspace that is not a subset of anRn followed
the deﬁnition of a vector space. The space in Example 1.12 of all real-valued
functions of one real variable{f |f : R→ R } has the subspace in Example 1.14
of functions satisfying the restriction(d2f/dx2) +f =0.
2.7 Example The deﬁnition requires that the addition and scalar multiplication
operations must be the ones inherited from the larger space. The setS = {1 } is
a subset ofR1. And, under the operations1 +1 =1 andr·1 =1 the setS is
a vector space, speciﬁcally, a trivial space. However,S is not a subspace ofR1
because those aren’t the inherited operations, since of courseR1 has1 +1 =2.
98 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
2.8 Example Being vector spaces themselves, subspaces must satisfy the closure
conditions. The set R+ is not a subspace of the vector spaceR1 because with
the inherited operations it is not closed under scalar multiplication: if⃗v =1
then −1· ⃗v⁄∈ R+.
The next result says that Example 2.8 is prototypical. The only way that
a subset can fail to be a subspace, if it is nonempty and uses the inherited
operations, is if it isn’t closed.
2.9 Lemma For a nonempty subsetS of a vector space, under the inherited
operations the following are equivalent statements.∗
(1) S is a subspace of that vector space
(2) S is closed under linear combinations of pairs of vectors: for any vectors
⃗s1,⃗s2∈S and scalarsr1,r2 the vectorr1⃗s1 +r2⃗s2 is inS
(3) S is closed under linear combinations of any number of vectors: for any
vectors ⃗s1,..., ⃗sn∈S and scalarsr1,...,r n the vectorr1⃗s1 +··· +rn⃗sn is
an element ofS.
Brieﬂy, a subset is a subspace if and only if it is closed under linear combinations.
Proof ‘The following are equivalent’ means that each pair of statements are
equivalent.
(1)⇐⇒ (2) ( 2)⇐⇒ (3) ( 3)⇐⇒ (1)
Wewillprove theequivalence by establishing that(1) =⇒ (3) =⇒ (2) =⇒ (1).
This strategy is suggested by the observation that the implications(1) =⇒ (3)
and (3) =⇒ (2) are easy and so we need only argue that(2) =⇒ (1).
Assume thatS is a nonempty subset of a vector spaceV that is closed under
combinations of pairs of vectors. We will show thatS is a vector space by
checking the conditions.
The vector space deﬁnition has ﬁve conditions on addition. First, for closure
under addition, if⃗s1,⃗s2∈S then ⃗s1 + ⃗s2∈S, as it is a combination of a pair
of vectors and we are assuming thatS is closed under those. Second, for any
⃗s1,⃗s2∈S, because addition is inherited fromV, the sum⃗s1 + ⃗s2 inS equals the
sum ⃗s1 + ⃗s2 inV, and that equals the sum⃗s2 + ⃗s1 inV (becauseV is a vector
space, its addition is commutative), and that in turn equals the sum⃗s2 + ⃗s1 in
S. The argument for the third condition is similar to that for the second. For
the fourth, consider the zero vector ofV and note that closure ofS under linear
combinations of pairs of vectors gives that0· ⃗s +0· ⃗s = ⃗0 is an element ofS
(where ⃗s is any member of the nonempty setS); checking that⃗0 acts under the
inherited operations as the additive identity ofS is easy. The ﬁfth condition
∗More information on equivalence of statements is in the appendix.
Section I. Deﬁnition of Vector Space 99
is satisﬁed because for any⃗s∈S, closure under linear combinations of pairs of
vectors shows that0· ⃗0 + (−1)· ⃗s is an element ofS, and it is obviously the
additive inverse of⃗s under the inherited operations. The veriﬁcations for the
scalar multiplication conditions are similar; see Exercise 35. QED
We will usually verify that a subset is a subspace by checking that it satisﬁes
statement (2).
2.10 Remark At the start of this chapter we introduced vector spaces as collections
in which linear combinations “make sense.” Lemma 2.9’s statements (1)-(3) say
that we can always make sense of an expression liker1⃗s1 +r2⃗s2 in that the
vector described is in the setS.
As a contrast, consider the setT of two-tall vectors whose entries add to
a number greater than or equal to zero. Here we cannot just write any linear
combination such as2⃗t1 −3⃗t2 and be conﬁdent the result is an element ofT.
Lemma 2.9 suggests that a good way to think of a vector space is as a
collection of unrestricted linear combinations. The next two examples take some
spaces and recasts their descriptions to be in that form.
2.11 Example We can show that this plane through the origin subset ofR3
S = {


x
y
z

 |x −2y +z =0 }
is a subspace under the usual addition and scalar multiplication operations
of column vectors by checking that it is nonempty and closed under linear
combinations of two vectors. But there is another way. Think ofx −2y +z =0
as a one-equation linear system and parametrize it by expressing the leading
variable in terms of the free variablesx =2y −z.
S = {


2y −z
y
z

 |y,z∈ R } = {y

2
1
0

 +z


−1
0
1

 |y,z∈ R } (∗)
Now, to show that this is a subspace considerr1⃗s1 +r2⃗s2. Each ⃗si is a linear
combination of the two vectors in (∗) so this is a linear combination of linear
combinations.




The Linear Combination Lemma, Lemma One.III.2.3, shows that the total is
a linear combination of the two vectors and so Lemma 2.9’s statement (2) is
satisﬁed.
100 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
2.12 Example This is a subspace of the2×2 matrices M2×2.
L = {
(
a 0
b c
)
|a +b +c =0 }
To parametrize, express the condition asa = −b −c.
L = {
(
−b −c 0
b c
)
|b,c∈ R } = {b
(
−1 0
1 0
)
+c
(
−1 0
0 1
)
|b,c∈ R }
As above, we’ve described the subspace as a collection of unrestricted linear
combinations. To show it is a subspace, note that a linear combination of vectors
fromL is a linear combination of linear combinations and so statement (2) is
true.
2.13 DeﬁnitionThe span (or linear closure) of a nonempty subsetS of a vector
space is the set of all linear combinations of vectors fromS.
[S] = {c1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn |c1,...,c n∈ R and ⃗s1,..., ⃗sn∈S}
The span of the empty subset of a vector space is its trivial subspace.
No notation for the span is completely standard. The square brackets used here
are common but so are ‘span(S)’ and ‘sp(S)’.
2.14 Remark In Chapter One, after we showed that we can write the solution
set of a homogeneous linear system as{c1⃗β1 +··· +ck⃗βk |c1,...,c k∈ R }, we
described that as the set ‘generated’ by the⃗β’s. We now call that the span of
{ ⃗β1,..., ⃗βk }.
Recall also from that proof that the span of the empty set is deﬁned to
be the set {⃗0 } because of the convention that a trivial linear combination, a
combination of zero-many vectors, adds to⃗0. Besides, deﬁning the empty set’s
span to be the trivial subspace is convenient because it keeps results like the
next one from needing exceptions for the empty set.
2.15 Lemma In a vector space, the span of any subset is a subspace.
Proof If the subsetS is empty then by deﬁnition its span is the trivial subspace.
IfS is not empty then by Lemma 2.9 we need only check that the span[S] is
closed under linear combinations of pairs of elements. For a pair of vectors from
that span, ⃗v = c1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn and ⃗w = cn+1⃗sn+1 +··· +cm⃗sm, a linear
combination
p· (c1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn) +r· (cn+1⃗sn+1 +··· +cm⃗sm)
=pc1⃗s1 +··· +pcn⃗sn +rcn+1⃗sn+1 +··· +rcm⃗sm
Section I. Deﬁnition of Vector Space 101
is a linear combination of elements ofS and so is an element of[S] (possibly
some of the⃗si’s from⃗v equal some of the⃗sj’s from⃗w but that does not matter).
QED
The converse of the lemma holds: any subspace is the span of some set,
because a subspace is obviously the span of itself, the set of all of its members.
Thus a subset of a vector space is a subspace if and only if it is a span. This
ﬁts the intuition that a good way to think of a vector space is as a collection in
which linear combinations are sensible.
Taken together, Lemma 2.9 and Lemma 2.15 show that the span of a subset
S of a vector space is the smallest subspace containing all of the members ofS.
2.16 Example In any vector spaceV, for any vector⃗v∈V, the set{r· ⃗v |r∈ R }
is a subspace ofV. For instance, for any vector⃗v∈ R3 the line through the
origin containing that vector{k⃗v |k∈ R } is a subspace ofR3. This is true even
if ⃗v is the zero vector, in which case it is the degenerate line, the trivial subspace.
2.17 Example The span of this set is all ofR2.
{

,
(

}
We know that the span is some subspace ofR2. To check that it is all ofR2 we
must show that any member ofR2 is a linear combination of these two vectors.
So we ask: for which vectors with real componentsx andy are there scalarsc1
andc2 such that this holds?
c1

+c2

(∗)
Gauss’s Method
c1 +c2 =x
c1 −c2 =y
−ρ1+ρ2
−→ c1 + c2 = x
−2c2 = −x +y
with back substitution givesc2 = (x −y)/2 andc1 = (x +y)/2. This shows
that for anyx,y there are appropriate coeﬃcientsc1,c2 making (∗) true—we
can write any element ofR2 as a linear combination of the two given ones. For
instance, forx =1 andy =2 the coeﬃcientsc2 = −1/2 andc1 =3/2 will do.
Since spans are subspaces, and we know that a good way to understand a
subspace is to parametrize its description, we can try to understand a set’s span
in that way.
2.18 Example Consider, in the vector space of quadratic polynomialsP2, the
span of the setS = {3x −x2,2x }. By the deﬁnition of span, it is the set of
102 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
unrestricted linear combinations of the two{c1(3x −x2) +c2(2x) |c1,c2∈ R }.
Clearly polynomials in this span must have a constant term of zero. Is that
necessary condition also suﬃcient?
We are asking: for which membersa2x2 +a1x +a0 of P2 are therec1 andc2
such thata2x2 +a1x +a0 =c1(3x −x2) +c2(2x)? Polynomials are equal when
their coeﬃcients are equal so we want conditions ona2,a1, anda0 making that
triple a solution of this system.
−c1 =a2
3c1 +2c2 =a1
0 =a0
Gauss’s Method and back-substitution givesc1 = −a2, andc2 = (3/2)a2 +
(1/2)a1, and0 =a0. Thus as long as there is no constant terma0 =0 we can
give coeﬃcientsc1 and c2 to describe that polynomial as an element of the
span. For instance, for the polynomial0 −4x +3x2, the coeﬃcientsc1 = −3 and
c2 =5/2 will do. So the span of the given set is[S] = {a1x +a2x2 |a1,a2∈ R }.
Incidentally, this shows that the set{x,x2 } spans the same subspace. A space
can have more than one spanning set. Two other sets spanning this subspace
are {x,x2, −x +2x2 } and {x,x +x2,x +2x2,... }.
2.19 Example The picture below shows the subspaces ofR3 that we now know
of: the trivial subspace, lines through the origin, planes through the origin, and
the whole space. (Of course, the picture shows only a few of the inﬁnitely many
cases. Line segments connect subsets with their supersets.) In the next section
we will prove thatR3 has no other kind of subspace, so in fact this lists them all.
This describes each subspace as the span of a set with a minimal number
of members. With this, the subspaces fall naturally into levels—planes on one
level, lines on another, etc.

Section I. Deﬁnition of Vector Space 103
So far in this chapter we have seen that to study the properties of linear
combinations, the right setting is a collection that is closed under these combi-
nations. In the ﬁrst subsection we introduced such collections, vector spaces,
and we saw a great variety of examples. In this subsection we saw still more
spaces, ones that are subspaces of others. In all of the variety there is a com-
monality. Example 2.19 above brings it out: vector spaces and subspaces are
best understood as a span, and especially as a span of a small number of vectors.
The next section studies spanning sets that are minimal.

2.31 Example 2.16 says that for any vector⃗v that is an element of a vector spaceV,
the set {r· ⃗v |r∈ R } is a subspace ofV. (This is simply the span of the singleton
set {⃗v }.) Must any such subspace be a proper subspace?
2.32 An example following the deﬁnition of a vector space shows that the solution
set of a homogeneous linear system is a vector space. In the terminology of this
subsection, it is a subspace ofRn where the system hasn variables. What about
a non-homogeneous linear system; do its solutions form a subspace (under the
inherited operations)?
2.33 [Cleary] Give an example of each or explain why it would be impossible to do
so.
(a) A nonempty subset ofM2×2 that is not a subspace.
(b) A set of two vectors inR2 that does not span the space.

trivial space have inﬁnitely many subspaces?

2.36 Show that each vector space has only one trivial subspace.
2.37 Show that for any subsetS of a vector space, the span of the span equals the
span [[S]] = [S]. (Hint. Members of [S] are linear combinations of members ofS.
Members of [[S]] are linear combinations of linear combinations of members ofS.)
2.38 All of the subspaces that we’ve seen in some way use zero in their description.
For example, the subspace in Example 2.3 consists of all the vectors fromR2 with
a second component of zero. In contrast, the collection of vectors fromR2 with a
second component of one does not form a subspace (it is not closed under scalar
multiplication). Another example is Example 2.2, where the condition on the
vectors is that the three components add to zero. If the condition there were that
the three components add to one then it would not be a subspace (again, it would
fail to be closed). However, a reliance on zero is not strictly necessary. Consider
the set

Does any subset ofR3 that contains the origin become a subspace when given

same subspaces, must the two be equal?

(b) Must the unionA∪B be a subspace?
(c) IfA is a subspace of someV, must its set complementV −A be a subspace?
(Hint. Try some test subspaces from Example 2.19.)
2.46 Does the span of a set depend on the enclosing space? That is, ifW is a
subspace ofV andS is a subset ofW (and so also a subset ofV), might the span
ofS inW diﬀer from the span ofS inV?
2.47 Is the relation ‘is a subspace of’ transitive? That is, ifV is a subspace ofW
andW is a subspace ofX, mustV be a subspace ofX?

II Linear Independence
The prior section shows how to understand a vector space as a span, as an
unrestricted linear combination of some of its elements. For example, the space
of linear polynomials{a +bx |a,b∈ R } is spanned by the set{1,x }. The prior
section also showed that a space can have many sets that span it. Two more
sets that span the space of linear polynomials are{1,2x } and {1,x,2x }.
At the end of that section we described some spanning sets as ‘minimal’
but we never precisely deﬁned that word. We could mean that a spanning
set is minimal if it contains the smallest number of members of any set with
the same span, so that{1,x,2x } is not minimal because it has three members
while we can give two-element sets spanning the same space. Or we could mean
that a spanning set is minimal when it has no elements that we can remove
without changing the span. Under this meaning{1,x,2x } is not minimal because
removing the2x to get {1,x } leaves the span unchanged.
The ﬁrst sense of minimality appears to be a global requirement, in that
to check if a spanning set is minimal we seemingly must look at all the sets
that span and ﬁnd one with the least number of elements. The second sense
of minimality is local since we need to look only at the set and consider the
span with and without various elements. For instance, using the second sense
we could compare the span of{1,x,2x } with the span of{1,x } and note that2x
is a “repeat” in that its removal doesn’t shrink the span.
In this section we will use the second sense of ‘minimal spanning set’ because
of this technical convenience. However, the most important result of this book
is that the two senses coincide. We will prove that in the next section.
II.1 Deﬁnition and Examples
We saw “repeats” in the ﬁrst chapter. There, Gauss’s Method turned them into
0 =0 equations.
1.1 Example Recall the Statics example from Chapter One’s opening. We got
two balances with the pair of unknown-mass objects, one at40 cm and15 cm
and another at−50 cm and25 cm, and we then computed the value of those
masses. Had we instead gotten the second balance at20 cm and7.5 cm then
Gauss’s Method on the resulting two-equations, two-unknowns system would
not have yielded a solution, it would have yielded a0 =0 equation along with
an equation containing a free variable. Intuitively, the problem is that(20 7.5)
is half of(40 15), that is,(20 7.5) is in the span of the set{ (40 15) } and so is
Section II. Linear Independence 109
repeated data. We would have been trying to solve a two-unknowns problem
with essentially only one piece of information.
We take⃗v to be a “repeat” of the vectors in a setS if ⃗v∈ [S] so that it depends
on, that is, is expressible in terms of, elements of the set⃗v =c1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn.
1.2 Lemma WhereV is a vector space,S is a subset of that space, and⃗v is an
element of that space,[S∪ {⃗v }] = [S] if and only if⃗v∈ [S].
Proof Half of the if and only if is immediate: if⃗v /∈ [S] then the sets are not
equal because ⃗v∈ [S∪ {⃗v }].
For the other half assume that⃗v∈ [S] so that⃗v =c1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn for some
scalarsci and vectors⃗si∈S. We will use mutual containment to show that the
sets [S∪ {⃗v }] and [S] are equal. The containment[S∪ {⃗v }]⊇ [S] is clear.
To show containment in the other direction let⃗w be an element of[S∪ {⃗v }].
Then ⃗w is a linear combination of elements ofS∪ {⃗v }, which we can write as
⃗w =cn+1⃗sn+1 +··· +cn+k⃗sn+k +cn+k+1⃗v. (Possibly some of the⃗si’s from
⃗w’s equation are the same as some of those from⃗v’s equation but that does not
matter.) Expand ⃗v.
⃗w =cn+1⃗sn+1 +··· +cn+k⃗sn+k +cn+k+1· (c1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn)
Recognize the right hand side as a linear combination of linear combinations of
vectors fromS. Thus ⃗w∈ [S]. QED
The discussion at the section’s opening involved removing vectors instead of
adding them.
1.3 Corollary For ⃗v∈ S, omitting that vector does not shrink the span[S] =
[S − {⃗v }] if and only if it is dependent on other vectors in the set⃗v∈ [S].
The corollary says that to know whether removing a vector will decrease the
span, we need to know whether the vector is a linear combination of others in
the set.
1.4 DeﬁnitionIn any vector space, a set of vectors islinearly independentif none
of its elements is a linear combination of the others from the set.∗ Otherwise
the set islinearly dependent.
Thus the set{⃗s0,..., ⃗sn } is independent if there is no equality⃗si =c0⃗s0 +
... +ci−1⃗si−1 +ci+1⃗si+1 +... +cn⃗sn. The deﬁnition’s use of the word ‘others’
means that writing⃗si as a linear combination via⃗si =1· ⃗si does not count.
∗See also Remark 1.13.
110 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
Observe that, although this way of writing one vector as a combination of
the others
⃗s0 =c1⃗s1 +c2⃗s2 +··· +cn⃗sn
visually sets oﬀ⃗s0, algebraically there is nothing special about that vector in
that equation. For any⃗si with a coeﬃcientci that is non-0 we can rewrite to
isolate ⃗si.
⃗si = (1/ci)⃗s0 +··· + (−ci−1/ci)⃗si−1 + (−ci+1/ci)⃗si+1 +··· + (−cn/ci)⃗sn
Whenwedon’twanttosingleoutanyvectorwewillinsteadsaythat ⃗s0,⃗s1,..., ⃗sn
are in alinear relationshipand put all of the vectors on the same side. The
next result rephrases the linear independence deﬁnition in this style. It is how
we usually compute whether a ﬁnite set is dependent or independent.
1.5 Lemma A subsetS of a vector space is linearly independent if and only if
among its elements the only linear relationshipc1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn = ⃗0 is the
trivial one,c1 =0,...,c n =0 (where ⃗si⁄= ⃗sj wheni⁄=j) .
Proof IfS is linearly independent then no vector⃗si is a linear combination
of other vectors fromS so there is no linear relationship where some of the⃗s’s
have nonzero coeﬃcients.
IfS is not linearly independent then some⃗si is a linear combination⃗si =
c1⃗s1 +··· +ci−1⃗si−1 +ci+1⃗si+1 +··· +cn⃗sn of other vectors fromS. Subtracting
⃗si from both sides gives a relationship involving a nonzero coeﬃcient, the−1 in
front of⃗si. QED
1.6 Example In the vector space of two-wide row vectors, the two-element set
{ (40 15), (−50 25) } is linearly independent. To check this, take
c1· (40 15) +c2· (−50 25) = (0 0)
and solve the resulting system.
40c1 −50c2 =0
15c1 +25c2 =0
−(15/40)ρ1+ρ2
−→ 40c1 − 50c2 =0
(175/4)c2 =0
Bothc1 andc2 are zero. So the only linear relationship between the two given
row vectors is the trivial relationship.
In the same vector space, the set{(40 15), (20 7.5) } is linearly dependent
since we can satisfyc1· (40 15) +c2· (20 7.5) = (0 0) withc1 =1 andc2 = −2.
1.7 Example The set {1 +x,1 −x } is linearly independent inP2, the space of
quadratic polynomials with real coeﬃcients, because
0 +0x +0x2 =c1(1 +x) +c2(1 −x) = (c1 +c2) + (c1 −c2)x +0x2
Section II. Linear Independence 111
gives
c1 +c2 =0
c1 −c2 =0
−ρ1+ρ2
−→ c1 + c2 =0
2c2 =0
since polynomials are equal only if their coeﬃcients are equal. Thus, the only
linear relationship between these two members ofP2 is the trivial one.
1.8 Remark The lemma speciﬁes that⃗si⁄= ⃗sj wheni⁄=j because of course if some
vector ⃗s appears twice then we can get a nontrivialc1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn = ⃗0, by
taking the associated coeﬃcients to be1 and −1. Besides, if some vector appears
more than once in an expression then we can always combine the coeﬃcients.
Note that the lemma allows the opposite of appearing more than once, that
some vectors fromS don’t appear at all. For instance, ifS is inﬁnite then because
linear relationships involve only ﬁnitely many vectors, any such relationship
leaves out many ofS’s vectors. However, note also that ifS is ﬁnite then where
convenient we can take a combinationc1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn to contain each ofS’s
vectors once and only once. If a vector is missing then we can add it by using a
coeﬃcient of0.
1.9 Example The rows of this matrix
A =


2 3 1 0
0 −1 0 −2
0 0 0 1


form a linearly independent set. This is easy to check for this case but also recall
that Lemma One.III.2.5 shows that the rows of any echelon form matrix form a
linearly independent set.
1.10 Example In R3, where
⃗v1 =


3
4
5

 ⃗v2 =


2
9
2

 ⃗v3 =


4
18
4


the setS = {⃗v1,⃗v2,⃗v3 } is linearly dependent because this is a relationship
0· ⃗v1 +2· ⃗v2 −1· ⃗v3 = ⃗0
where not all of the scalars are zero (the fact that some of the scalars are zero
doesn’t matter).
That example illustrates why, although Deﬁnition 1.4 is a clearer statement
of what independence means, Lemma 1.5 is better for computations. Working
straight from the deﬁnition, someone trying to compute whetherS is linearly
independent would start by setting⃗v1 =c2⃗v2 +c3⃗v3 and concluding that there
112 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
are no suchc2 andc3. But knowing that the ﬁrst vector is not dependent on the
other two is not enough. This person would have to go on to try⃗v2 =c1⃗v1 +c3⃗v3,
in order to ﬁnd the dependencec1 =0, c3 =1/2. Lemma 1.5 gets the same
conclusion with only one computation.
1.11 Example The empty subset of a vector space is linearly independent. There
is no nontrivial linear relationship among its members as it has no members.
1.12 Example In any vector space, any subset containing the zero vector is linearly
dependent. One example is, in the spaceP2 of quadratic polynomials, the subset
{1 +x,x +x2,0 }. It is linearly dependent because0· ⃗v1 +0· ⃗v2 +1· ⃗0 = ⃗0 is a
nontrivial relationship, since not all of the coeﬃcients are zero.
There is a subtle point that we shall see a number of times and that bears
on the prior example. It is about the trivial sum, the sum of the empty set.
One way to see how to deﬁne the trivial sum is to consider the progression
⃗v1 + ⃗v2 + ⃗v3, followed by⃗v1 + ⃗v2, followed by⃗v1. The diﬀerence between the
sum of three vectors and the sum of two is⃗v3. Then the diﬀerence between the
sum of two and the sum of one is⃗v2. In next passing to the trivial sum, the
sum of zero-many vectors, we can expect to subtract⃗v1. So we deﬁne the sum
of zero-many vectors to be the zero vector.
The relation with the prior example is that if the zero vector is in a set then
that set has an element that is a combination of a subset of other vectors from
the set, speciﬁcally, the zero vector is a combination of the empty subset. Even
the setS = {⃗0 } is linearly dependent, because⃗0 is the sum of the empty set and
the empty set is a subset ofS.
1.13 Remark The deﬁnition of linear independence, Deﬁnition 1.4, refers to a
‘set’ of vectors. Sets are the most familiar kind of collection and in practice
everyone refers to these collections as sets. But to be complete we will note that
sets are not quite the right kind of collection for this purpose.
Recall that a set is a collection with two properties: (i) order does not matter,
so that the set{1,2 } equals the set{2,1 }, and (ii) duplicates collapse, so that
the set {1,1,2 } equals the set{1,2 }.
Now consider this matrix reduction.

1 1 1
2 2 2
1 2 3


(1/2)ρ2
−→


1 1 1
1 1 1
1 2 3


On the left the set of matrix rows{(1 1 1), (2 2 2), (1 2 3) } is linearly de-
pendent. On the right the set of rows is{(1 1 1), (1 1 1), (1 2 3) }. Because
duplicates collapse, that equals the set{ (1 1 1), (1 2 3) }, which is linearly
independent. That’s a problem because Gauss’s Method should preserve linear
dependence.
Section II. Linear Independence 113
That is, strictly speaking, we need a type of collection where duplicates do
not collapse. A collection where order does not matter and duplicates don’t
collapse is amultiset.
However, the standard terminology here is ‘set’ and departing from a standard
has its own pitfalls, so we will use that word also. Later we shall occasionally
need to take combinations without letting duplicates collapse and we shall do
that without further comment.
1.14 Corollary A setS is linearly independent if and only if for any⃗v∈S, its
removal shrinks the span[S − {v }] ⊊ [S].
Proof This follows from Corollary 1.3. IfS is linearly independent then none
of its vectors is dependent on the other elements, so removal of any vector will
shrink the span. IfS is not linearly independent then it contains a vector that
is dependent on other elements of the set, and removal of that vector will not
shrink the span. QED
So a spanning set is minimal if and only if it is linearly independent.
The prior result addresses removing elements from a linearly independent
set. The next one adds elements.
1.15 Lemma Suppose thatS is linearly independent and that⃗v /∈S. Then the
setS∪ {⃗v } is linearly independent if and only if⃗v /∈ [S].
Proof We will show thatS∪ {⃗v } is not linearly independent if and only if
⃗v∈ [S].
Suppose ﬁrst that⃗v∈ [S]. Express ⃗v as a combination⃗v =c1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn.
Rewrite that ⃗0 =c1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn −1· ⃗v. Since ⃗v /∈S, it does not equal any of
the ⃗si so this is a nontrivial linear dependence among the elements ofS∪ {⃗v }.
Thus that set is not linearly independent.
Now suppose thatS∪{⃗v } is not linearly independent and consider a nontrivial
dependence among its members⃗0 =c1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn +cn+1· ⃗v. Ifcn+1 =0
then that is a dependence among the elements ofS, but we are assuming thatS
is independent, socn+1⁄=0. Rewrite the equation as⃗v = (c1/cn+1)⃗s1 +··· +
(cn/cn+1)⃗sn to get⃗v∈ [S] QED
1.16 Example This subset ofR3 is linearly independent.
S = {


1


 }
The span ofS is thex-axis. Here are two supersets, one that is linearly dependent
and the other independent.
114 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

,




 }
We got the dependent superset by adding a vector from thex-axis and so the
span did not grow. We got the independent superset by adding a vector that
isn’t in[S], because it has a nonzeroy component, causing the span to grow.
For the independent set
S = {


1
0
0

,


0



the span [S] is thexy-plane. Here are two supersets.

As above, the additional member of the dependent superset comes from[S],
thexy-plane, while the added member of the independent superset comes from
outside of that span.
Finally, consider this independent set
S = {


1

0

,


0
1
0


with [S] = R3. We can get a linearly dependent superset.

But there is no linearly independent superset ofS. One way to see that is to
note that for any vector that we would add toS, the equation


x


 =c1

has a solutionc1 =x, c2 =y, andc3 =z. Another way to see it is that we
cannot add any vectors from outside of the span[S] because that span isR3.
Section II. Linear Independence 115
1.17 Corollary In a vector space, any ﬁnite set has a linearly independent subset
with the same span.
Proof If S = {⃗s1,..., ⃗sn } is linearly independent thenS itself satisﬁes the
statement, so assume that it is linearly dependent.
By the deﬁnition of dependent,S contains a vector ⃗v1 that is a linear
combination of the others. Deﬁne the setS1 =S − {⃗v1 }. By Corollary 1.3 the
span does not shrink[S1] = [S].
IfS1 is linearly independent then we are done. Otherwise iterate: take a
vector ⃗v2 that is a linear combination of other members ofS1 and discard it
to deriveS2 = S1 − {⃗v2 } such that [S2] = [ S1]. Repeat this until a linearly
independent setSj appears; one must appear eventually becauseS is ﬁnite and
the empty set is linearly independent. (Formally, this argument uses induction
on the number of elements inS. Exercise 42 asks for the details.) QED
Thus if we have a set that is linearly dependent then we can, without changing
the span, pare down by discarding what we have called “repeat” vectors.

pendent.

shrinking the span.
Similarly, setc3 =1, andc5 =0 to get an instance of (∗) that shows we can
discardS’s third vector without shrinking the span. Thus this set has the same

1.19 Corollary A subsetS = {⃗s1,..., ⃗sn } of a vector space is linearly dependent
if and only if some⃗si is a linear combination of the vectors⃗s1, ..., ⃗si−1 listed
before it.
Proof ConsiderS0 = { },S1 = { ⃗s1 },S2 = {⃗s1,⃗s2 }, etc. Some indexi >1 is the
ﬁrst one withSi−1∪ {⃗si } linearly dependent, and there⃗si∈ [Si−1]. QED
The proof of Corollary 1.17 describes producing a linearly independent set
by shrinking, by taking subsets. And the proof of Corollary 1.19 describes
ﬁnding a linearly dependent set by taking supersets. We ﬁnish this subsection
by considering how linear independence and dependence interact with the subset
relation between sets.
1.20 Lemma Any subset of a linearly independent set is also linearly independent.
Any superset of a linearly dependent set is also linearly dependent.
Proof Both are clear. QED
Restated, subset preserves independence and superset preserves dependence.
Those are two of the four possible cases. The third case, whether subset
preserves linear dependence, is covered by Example 1.18, which gives a linearly
dependent setS with one subset that is linearly dependent and another that is
independent. The fourth case, whether superset preserves linear independence,
is covered by Example 1.16, which gives cases where a linearly independent set
has both an independent and a dependent superset. This table summarizes.
Section II. Linear Independence 117
ˆS⊂S ˆS⊃S
S independent ˆS must be independent ˆS may be either
S dependent ˆS may be either ˆS must be dependent
Example 1.16 has something else to say about the interaction between linear
independence and superset. It names a linearly independent set that is maximal
in that it has no supersets that are linearly independent. By Lemma 1.15 a
linearly independent set is maximal if and only if it spans the entire space,
because that is when all the vectors in the space are already in the span. This
nicely complements Lemma 1.14, that a spanning set is minimal if and only if it
is linearly independent.

✓ 1.40 Linear independence and linear dependence are properties of sets. We can thus
naturally ask how the properties of linear independence and dependence act with
respect to the familiar elementary set relations and operations. In this body of this
subsection we have covered the subset and superset relations. We can also consider
the operations of intersection, complementation, and union.
(a) How does linear independence relate to intersection: can an intersection of
linearly independent sets be independent? Must it be?
(b) How does linear independence relate to complementation?
(c) Show that the union of two linearly independent sets can be linearly indepen-
dent.
(d) Show that the union of two linearly independent sets need not be linearly
independent.
1.41 Continued from prior exercise.What is the interaction between the property
of linear independence and the operation of union?
(a) We might conjecture that the unionS∪T of linearly independent sets is linearly
independent if and only if their spans have a trivial intersection[S]∩ [T ] = {⃗0 }.
What is wrong with this argument for the ‘if’ direction of that conjecture? “If
the unionS∪T is linearly independent then the only solution toc1⃗s1 +··· +
cn⃗sn +d1⃗t1 +··· +dm⃗tm = ⃗0 is the trivial onec1 = 0, ..., dm = 0. So any
member of the intersection of the spans must be the zero vector because in
c1⃗s1 +··· +cn⃗sn =d1⃗t1 +··· +dm⃗tm each scalar is zero.”
(b) Give an example showing that the conjecture is false.
(c) Find linearly independent setsS andT so that the union ofS − (S∩T ) and
T − (S∩T ) is linearly independent, but the unionS∪T is not linearly independent.

the set{g(x) =1/(1 −x),f0(x) =1,f1(x) =x,f2(x) =x2,... } (in the vector space
that we are considering)? (Hint. Review the deﬁnition of linear combination.)
(c) Show that the set in the prior item is linearly independent.
This shows that some vector spaces exist with linearly independent subsets that
are inﬁnite.
1.46 Show that, whereS is a subspace ofV, if a subsetT ofS is linearly independent
inS thenT is also linearly independent inV. Is that ‘only if’?

III Basis and Dimension
The prior section ends with the observation that a spanning set is minimal when
it is linearly independent and a linearly independent set is maximal when it spans
the space. So the notions of minimal spanning set and maximal independent set
coincide. In this section we will name this idea and study its properties.
III.1 Basis
1.1 DeﬁnitionA basis for a vector space is a sequence of vectors that is linearly
independent and that spans the space.
Because a basis is a sequence, meaning that bases are diﬀerent if they contain
the same elements but in diﬀerent orders, we denote it with angle brackets
⟨⃗β1, ⃗β2,... ⟩.∗ (A sequence is linearly independent if the multiset consisting of
the elements of the sequence is independent. Similarly, a sequence spans the
space if the set of elements of the sequence spans the space.)
1.2 Example This is a basis forR2.
⟨

It is linearly independent

=⇒ 2c1 +1c2 =0
4c1 +1c2 =0 =⇒ c1 =c2 =0
and it spansR2.
2c1 +1c2 =x
4c1 +1c2 =y =⇒ c2 =2x −y andc1 = (y −x)/2
1.3 Example This basis forR2 diﬀers from the prior one
⟨
(
1

)
,
(

)
⟩
because it is in a diﬀerent order. The veriﬁcation that it is a basis is just as in
the prior example.
∗ More information on sequences is in the appendix.

1.4 Example The space R2 has many bases. Another one is this.

is thestandard (or natural) basis. We denote these vectors⃗e1,..., ⃗en.
Calculus books denoteR2’s standard basis vectors as⃗ı and ⃗ instead of ⃗e1 and
⃗e2 and they denote toR3’s standard basis vectors as⃗ı, ⃗, and ⃗k instead of ⃗e1,
⃗e2, and ⃗e3. Note that⃗e1 means something diﬀerent in a discussion ofR3 than
it means in a discussion ofR2.
1.6 Example Consider the space{a·cosθ +b·sinθ |a,b∈ R } of functions of the
real variableθ. This is a natural basis⟨cosθ,sinθ⟩ =⟨1·cosθ+0·sinθ,0·cosθ+
1·sinθ⟩. A more generic basis for this space is⟨cosθ −sinθ,2 cosθ +3sinθ⟩.
Veriﬁcation that these two are bases is Exercise 29.
1.7 Example A natural basis for the vector space of cubic polynomialsP3 is
⟨1,x,x 2,x3⟩. Two other bases for this space are⟨x3,3x2,6x,6⟩ and⟨1,1 +x,1 +
x +x2,1 +x +x2 +x3⟩. Checking that each is linearly independent and spans
the space is easy.
1.8 Example The trivial space{⃗0 } has only one basis, the empty one⟨⟩.
1.9 Example The space of ﬁnite-degree polynomials has a basis with inﬁnitely
many elements⟨1,x,x 2,... ⟩.
1.10 Example We have seen bases before. In the ﬁrst chapter we described the
solution set of homogeneous systems such as this one
x +y −w =0
z +w =0
by parametrizing.

Section III. Basis and Dimension 123
Thus the vector space of solutions is the span of a two-element set. This two-
vector set is also linearly independent, which is easy to check. Therefore the
solution set is a subspace ofR4 with a basis comprised of these two vectors.
1.11 Example Parametrization ﬁnds bases for other vector spaces, not just for
solution sets of homogeneous systems. To ﬁnd a basis for this subspace ofM2×2
{
(
a b
c 0
)
|a +b −2c =0 }
we rewrite the condition asa = −b +2c.
{
(
−b +2c b

)
|b,c∈ R } = {b
(
−1 1

Thus, this is a natural candidate for a basis.

The above work shows that it spans the space. Linear independence is also easy.
Consider again Example 1.2. To verify that the set spans the space we looked
at linear combinations that total to a member of the spacec1⃗β1 +c2⃗β2 =
(x
y
)
.
We only noted in that example that such a combination exists, that for eachx,y
there exists ac1,c2, but in fact the calculation also shows that the combination
is unique:c1 must be (y −x)/2 andc2 must be2x −y.
1.12 Theorem In any vector space, a subset is a basis if and only if each vector
in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of elements of the subset
in one and only one way.
We consider linear combinations to be the same if they have the same summands
but in a diﬀerent order, or if they diﬀer only in the addition or deletion of terms
of the form ‘0· ⃗β’.
Proof A sequence is a basis if and only if its vectors form a set that spans and
that is linearly independent. A subset is a spanning set if and only if each vector
in the space is a linear combination of elements of that subset in at least one
way. Thus we need only show that a spanning subset is linearly independent if
and only if every vector in the space is a linear combination of elements from
the subset in at most one way.
Consider two expressions of a vector as a linear combination of the members
of the subset. Rearrange the two sums, and if necessary add some 0· ⃗βi
124 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
terms, so that the two sums combine the same⃗β’s in the same order:⃗v =
c1⃗β1 +c2⃗β2 +··· +cn⃗βn and ⃗v =d1⃗β1 +d2⃗β2 +··· +dn⃗βn. Now
c1⃗β1 +c2⃗β2 +··· +cn⃗βn =d1⃗β1 +d2⃗β2 +··· +dn⃗βn
holds if and only if
(c1 −d1)⃗β1 +··· + (cn −dn)⃗βn = ⃗0
holds. So, asserting that each coeﬃcient in the lower equation is zero is the same
thing as asserting thatci =di for eachi, that is, that every vector is expressible
as a linear combination of the⃗β’s in a unique way. QED
1.13 DeﬁnitionIn a vector space with basisB the representation of ⃗v with
respect toB is the column vector of the coeﬃcients used to express⃗v as a linear
combination of the basis vectors:
RepB(⃗v) =


c1
c2
...
cn


B
where B =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ and ⃗v = c1⃗β1 +c2⃗β2 +··· +cn⃗βn. The c’s are the
coordinates of⃗v with respect toB.
1.14 Example In P3, with respect to the basisB =⟨1,2x,2x 2,2x3⟩, the represen-
tation ofx +x2 is
RepB(x +x2) =


0
1/2
1/2
0


B
because x +x2 = 0·1 + (1/2)·2x + (1/2)·2x2 +0·2x3. With respect to a
diﬀerent basisD =⟨1 +x,1 −x,x +x2,x +x3⟩, the representation is diﬀerent.
RepD(x +x2) =


0
0
1



D
1.15 Remark Deﬁnition 1.1 requires that a basis be a sequence so that we can
write these coordinates in an order.
When there is only one basis around, we often omit the subscript naming
that basis.
Section III. Basis and Dimension 125
1.16 Example In R2, to ﬁnd the coordinates of the vector⃗v =
(3

)
with respect

B =⟨

=

2
)
and get thatc1 =3 andc2 = −1/2.
RepB(⃗v) =
(
3
−1/2
)
Writing the representation as a column generalizes the familiar case: inRn
and with respect to the standard basisEn, the vector starting at the origin and
ending at (v1,...,v n) has this representation.
RepEn (


v1
...
vn

) =


v1
...
vn


En
This is an example.
RepEn (
(
−1
1
)
) =
(
−1
1
)
1.17 Remark The RepB(⃗v) notation is not standard. The most common notation
is [⃗v]B but one advantage thatRepB(⃗v) has is that it is harder to misinterpret
or overlook.
The column represent the vector in the sense that a linear relationship holds
among a set of vectors if and only if that relationship holds among the set of
representations.
1.18 Lemma WhereB is a basis withn elements, for any set of vectorsa1⃗v1 +
··· +ak⃗vk = ⃗0V if and only ifa1RepB(⃗v1) +··· +akRepB(⃗vk) = ⃗0Rn.
Proof Fix a basisB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ and suppose
RepB(⃗v1) =


c1,1
...
cn,1

 ... RepB(⃗vk) =


c1,k
...
cn,k


126 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
so that⃗v1 =c1,1⃗β1 +··· +cn,1⃗βn, etc. Thena1⃗v1 +··· +ak⃗vk = ⃗0 is equivalent
to these.
⃗0 =a1· (c1,1⃗β1 +··· +cn,1⃗βn) +··· +ak· (c1,k⃗β1 +··· +cn,k⃗βn)
= (a1c1,1 +··· +akc1,k)· ⃗β1 +··· + (a1cn,1 +··· +akcn,k)· ⃗βn
Obviously the bottom equation is true if the coeﬃcients are zero. But, because
B is a basis, Theorem 1.12 says that the bottom equation is true if and only if
the coeﬃcients are zero. So the relation is equivalent to this.
a1c1,1 +··· +akc1,k =0
...
a1cn,1 +··· +akcn,k =0
This is the equivalent recast into column vectors.

Note that not only does a relationship hold for one set if and only if it holds for
the other, but it is the same relationship—theai are the same. QED

Our main use of representations will come later but the deﬁnition appears
here because the fact that every vector is a linear combination of basis vectors in
a unique way is a crucial property of bases, and also to help make a point. For
calculation of coordinates among other things, we shall restrict our attention
to spaces with bases having only ﬁnitely many elements. That will start in the
next subsection.

III.2 Dimension
The previous subsection deﬁnes a basis of a vector space and shows that a space
can have many diﬀerent bases. So we cannot talk about “the” basis for a vector
space. True, some vector spaces have bases that strike us as more natural than
others, for instance, R2’s basisE2 or P2’s basis⟨1,x,x 2⟩. But for the vector
space {a2x2 +a1x +a0 |2a2 −a0 =a1 }, no particular basis leaps out at us as
the natural one. We cannot, in general, associate with a space any single basis
that best describes it.
We can however ﬁnd something about the bases that is uniquely associated
with the space. This subsection shows that any two bases for a space have the
same number of elements. So with each space we can associate a number, the
number of vectors in any of its bases.
Before we start, we ﬁrst limit our attention to spaces where at least one basis
has only ﬁnitely many members.
2.1 DeﬁnitionA vector space isﬁnite-dimensionalif it has a basis with only
ﬁnitely many vectors.
One space that is not ﬁnite-dimensional is the set of polynomials with real
coeﬃcients, Example 1.11. This is not spanned by any ﬁnite subset since that
would contain a polynomial of largest degree but this space has polynomials
of all degrees. Such spaces are interesting and important but we will focus
in a diﬀerent direction. From now on we will study only ﬁnite-dimensional
vector spaces. In the rest of this book we shall take ‘vector space’ to mean
‘ﬁnite-dimensional vector space’.
To prove the main theorem we shall use a technical result, the Exchange
Lemma. We ﬁrst illustrate it with an example.

and the result is another basis forR3.
2.3 Lemma (Exchange Lemma) Assume thatB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ is a basis for a
vector space, and that for the vector⃗v the relationship ⃗v =c1⃗β1 +c2⃗β2 +··· +
cn⃗βn hasci⁄=0. Then exchanging⃗βi for ⃗v yields another basis for the space.
Proof Call the outcome of the exchangeˆB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βi−1,⃗v, ⃗βi+1,..., ⃗βn⟩.
We ﬁrst show thatˆB is linearly independent. Any relationshipd1⃗β1 +··· +
di⃗v +··· +dn⃗βn = ⃗0 among the members ofˆB, after substitution for⃗v,
d1⃗β1 +··· +di· (c1⃗β1 +··· +ci⃗βi +··· +cn⃗βn) +··· +dn⃗βn = ⃗0 (∗)
gives a linear relationship among the members ofB. The basis B is linearly
independent so the coeﬃcientdici of ⃗βi is zero. Because we assumed thatci is
nonzero,di =0. Using this in equation(∗) gives that all of the otherd’s are
also zero. ThereforeˆB is linearly independent.
We ﬁnish by showing thatˆB has the same span asB. Half of this argument,
that [ˆB]⊆ [B], iseasy; wecanwriteanymember d1⃗β1+··· +di⃗v+··· +dn⃗βn of [ˆB]
asd1⃗β1 +··· +di·(c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn)+··· +dn⃗βn, which is a linear combination
of linear combinations of members ofB, and hence is in[B]. For the[B]⊆ [ˆB]
half of the argument, recall that if⃗v =c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn withci⁄=0 then we can
rearrange the equation to⃗βi = (−c1/ci)⃗β1 +··· + (1/ci)⃗v +··· + (−cn/ci)⃗βn.
Now, consider any memberd1⃗β1 +··· +di⃗βi +··· +dn⃗βn of [B], substitute for
⃗βi its expression as a linear combination of the members ofˆB, and recognize,
as in the ﬁrst half of this argument, that the result is a linear combination of
linear combinations of members ofˆB, and hence is in[ˆB]. QED

2.4 Theorem In any ﬁnite-dimensional vector space, all bases have the same
number of elements.
Proof Fix a vector space with at least one ﬁnite basis. Choose, from among
all of this space’s bases, oneB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ of minimal size. We will show
that any other basisD =⟨⃗δ1,⃗δ2,... ⟩ also has the same number of members,n.
BecauseB has minimal size,D has no fewer thann vectors. We will argue that
it cannot have more thann vectors.
The basisB spans the space and⃗δ1 is in the space, so⃗δ1 is a nontrivial linear
combination of elements ofB. By the Exchange Lemma, we can swap⃗δ1 for a
vector fromB, resulting in a basisB1, where one element is⃗δ1 and all of the
n −1 other elements are⃗β’s.
The prior paragraph forms the basis step for an induction argument. The
inductive step starts with a basisBk (for1 ⩽k<n ) containingk members ofD
andn −k members ofB. We know thatD has at leastn members so there is a
⃗δk+1. Represent it as a linear combination of elements ofBk. The key point: in
that representation, at least one of the nonzero scalars must be associated with
a ⃗βi or else that representation would be a nontrivial linear relationship among
elements of the linearly independent setD. Exchange ⃗δk+1 for ⃗βi to get a new
basisBk+1 with one⃗δ more and one⃗β fewer than the previous basisBk.
Repeat that until no⃗β’s remain, so thatBn contains ⃗δ1,..., ⃗δn. Now, D
cannot have more than thesen vectors because any⃗δn+1 that remains would be
in the span ofBn (since it is a basis) and hence would be a linear combination
of the other⃗δ’s, contradicting thatD is linearly independent. QED
2.5 DeﬁnitionThe dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any
of its bases.
2.6 Example Any basis forRn hasn vectors since the standard basisEn hasn
vectors. Thus, this deﬁnition of ‘dimension’ generalizes the most familiar use of
term, that Rn isn-dimensional.
2.7 Example The space Pn of polynomials of degree at mostn has dimension
n+1. We can show this by exhibiting any basis—⟨1,x,...,x n⟩ comes to mind—
and counting its members.
2.8 Example The space of functions {a·cosθ +b·sinθ |a,b∈ R } of the real
variableθ has dimension2 since this space has the basis⟨cosθ,sinθ⟩.
2.9 Example A trivial space is zero-dimensional since its basis is empty.
Again, although we sometimes say ‘ﬁnite-dimensional’ for emphasis, from
now on we take all vector spaces to be ﬁnite-dimensional. So in the next result
the word ‘space’ means ‘ﬁnite-dimensional vector space’.
132 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
2.10 Corollary No linearly independent set can have a size greater than the
dimension of the enclosing space.
Proof The proof of Theorem 2.4 never uses thatD spans the space, only that
it is linearly independent. QED
2.11 Example Recall the diagram from Example I.2.19 showing the subspaces
of R3. Each subspace is described with a minimal spanning set, a basis. The
whole space has a basis with three members, the plane subspaces have bases
with two members, the line subspaces have bases with one member, and the
trivial subspace has a basis with zero members.
In that section we could not show that these areR3’s only subspaces. We can
show it now. The prior corollary proves that There are no, say, ﬁve-dimensional
subspaces of three-space. Further, by Deﬁnition 2.5 the dimension of every
space is a whole number so there are no subspaces ofR3 that are somehow
1.5-dimensional, between lines and planes. Thus the list of subspaces that we
gave is exhaustive; the only subspaces ofR3 are either three-, two-, one-, or
zero-dimensional.
2.12 Corollary Any linearly independent set can be expanded to make a basis.
Proof If a linearly independent set is not already a basis then it must not span
the space. Adding to the set a vector that is not in the span will preserve linear
independence by Lemma II.1.15. Keep adding until the resulting set does span
the space, which the prior corollary shows will happen after only a ﬁnite number
of steps. QED
2.13 Corollary Any spanning set can be shrunk to a basis.
Proof Call the spanning setS. If S is empty then it is already a basis (the
space must be a trivial space). IfS = {⃗0 } then it can be shrunk to the empty
basis, thereby making it linearly independent, without changing its span.
Otherwise, S contains a vector ⃗s1 with ⃗s1⁄= ⃗0 and we can form a basis
B1 =⟨⃗s1⟩. If [B1] = [S] then we are done. If not then there is a⃗s2∈ [S] such
that ⃗s2⁄∈ [B1]. LetB2 =⟨⃗s1, ⃗s2⟩; by Lemma II.1.15 this is linearly independent
so if [B2] = [S] then we are done.
We can repeat this process until the spans are equal, which must happen in
at most ﬁnitely many steps. QED
2.14 Corollary In ann-dimensional space, a set composed ofn vectors is linearly
independent if and only if it spans the space.
Section III. Basis and Dimension 133
Proof First we will show that a subset withn vectors is linearly independent if
and only if it is a basis. The ‘if’ is trivially true—bases are linearly independent.
‘Only if’ holds because a linearly independent set can be expanded to a basis,
but a basis hasn elements, so this expansion is actually the set that we began
with.
To ﬁnish, we will show that any subset withn vectors spans the space if and
only if it is a basis. Again, ‘if’ is trivial. ‘Only if’ holds because any spanning
set can be shrunk to a basis, but a basis hasn elements and so this shrunken
set is just the one we started with. QED
The main result of this subsection, that all of the bases in a ﬁnite-dimensional
vector space have the same number of elements, is the single most important
result in this book. As Example 2.11 shows, it describes what vector spaces and
subspaces there can be.
One immediate consequence brings us back to when we considered the two
things that could be meant by the term ‘minimal spanning set’. At that point we
deﬁned ‘minimal’ as linearly independent but we noted that another reasonable
interpretation of the term is that a spanning set is ‘minimal’ when it has the
fewest number of elements of any set with the same span. Now that we have
shown that all bases have the same number of elements, we know that the two
senses of ‘minimal’ are equivalent.

Section III. Basis and Dimension 135
2.36 A basis for a space consists of elements of that space. So we are naturally led to
how the property ‘is a basis’ interacts with operations⊆ and∩ and∪. (Of course,
a basis is actually a sequence that it is ordered, but there is a natural extension of
these operations.)
(a) Consider ﬁrst how bases might be related by⊆. Assume that U,W are
subspaces of some vector space and thatU⊆W. Can there exist basesBU forU
andBW forW such thatBU⊆BW? Must such bases exist?
For any basisBU forU, must there be a basisBW forW such thatBU⊆BW?

(b) Prove that equality of dimension holds if and only ifU =W.
(c) Show that the prior item does not hold if they are inﬁnite-dimensional.
2.38 Here is an alternative proof of this section’s main result, Theorem 2.4. First is
an example, then a lemma, then the theorem.

(b) In that combination pick a basis vector with a non-zero coeﬃcient. AlterB
by exchanging⃗v for that basis vector, to get a new sequenceˆB. Check thatˆB is
also a basis forR3.

and that for the vector⃗v the relationship⃗v =c1⃗β1 +c2⃗β2 +··· +cn⃗βn hasci⁄=0.
Prove that exchanging⃗v for ⃗βi yields another basis for the space.

dimension ofV?
136 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
III.3 Vector Spaces and Linear Systems
We will now reconsider linear systems and Gauss’s Method, aided by the tools
and terms of this chapter. We will make three points.
For the ﬁrst, recall the insight from the Chapter One that Gauss’s Method
works by taking linear combinations of rows—if two matrices are related by
row operationsA−→···−→ B then each row ofB is a linear combination of
the rows ofA. Therefore, the right setting in which to study row operations in
general, and Gauss’s Method in particular, is the following vector space.
3.1 DeﬁnitionThe row spaceof a matrix is the span of the set of its rows. The
row rankis the dimension of this space, the number of linearly independent
rows.
3.2 Example If
A =
(
2 3
4 6
)
then Rowspace(A) is this subspace of the space of two-component row vectors.
{c1· (2 3) +c2· (4 6) |c1,c2∈ R }
The second row vector is linearly dependent on the ﬁrst and so we can simplify
the above description to{c· (2 3) |c∈ R }.
3.3 Lemma If two matricesA andB are related by a row operation
A
ρi↔ρj
−→ B or A
kρi
−→ B or A
kρi+ρj
−→ B
(fori⁄=j andk⁄=0) then their row spaces are equal. Hence, row-equivalent
matrices have the same row space and therefore the same row rank.
Proof Corollary One.III.2.4 shows that whenA−→B then each row ofB is a
linear combination of the rows ofA. That is, in the above terminology, each row
ofB is an element of the row space ofA. Then Rowspace(B)⊆ Rowspace(A)
follows because a member of the setRowspace(B) is a linear combination of the
rows ofB, so it is a combination of combinations of the rows ofA, and by the
Linear Combination Lemma is also a member of Rowspace(A).
For the other set containment, recall Lemma One.III.1.5, that row opera-
tions are reversible soA−→B if and only ifB−→A. Then Rowspace(A)⊆
Rowspace(B) follows as in the previous paragraph. QED
Of course, Gauss’s Method performs the row operations systematically, with
the goal of echelon form.
Section III. Basis and Dimension 137
3.4 Lemma The nonzero rows of an echelon form matrix make up a linearly
independent set.
Proof Lemma One.III.2.5 says that no nonzero row of an echelon form matrix
is a linear combination of the other rows. This result restates that using this
chapter’s terminology. QED
Thus, inthelanguageofthischapter, Gaussianreductionworksbyeliminating
linear dependences among rows, leaving the span unchanged, until no nontrivial
linear relationships remain among the nonzero rows. In short, Gauss’s Method
produces a basis for the row space.
3.5 Example From any matrix, we can produce a basis for the row space by
performing Gauss’s Method and taking the nonzero rows of the resulting echelon
form matrix. For instance,


1 3 1
1 4 1
2 0 5


−ρ1+ρ2
−→
−2ρ1+ρ3
6ρ2+ρ3
−→


1 3 1
0 1 0
0 0 3


produces the basis⟨(1 3 1), (0 1 0), (0 0 3)⟩ for the row space. This is a basis
for the row space of both the starting and ending matrices, since the two row
spaces are equal.
Using this technique, we can also ﬁnd bases for spans not directly involving
row vectors.
3.6 DeﬁnitionThe column spaceof a matrix is the span of the set of its columns.
The column rankis the dimension of the column space, the number of linearly
independent columns.
Our interest in column spaces stems from our study of linear systems. An
example is that this system
c1 +3c2 +7c3 =d1
2c1 +3c2 +8c3 =d2
c2 +2c3 =d3
4c1 +4c3 =d4
has a solution if and only if the vector ofd’s is a linear combination of the other
column vectors,

138 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
meaning that the vector ofd’s is in the column space of the matrix of coeﬃcients.
3.7 Example Given this matrix,


1 3 7
2 3 8
0 1 2
4 0 4


to get a basis for the column space, temporarily turn the columns into rows and
reduce.





The result is a basis for the column space of the given matrix.
3.8 DeﬁnitionThe transpose of a matrix is the result of interchanging its rows
and columns, so that columnj of the matrixA is rowj ofAT and vice versa.
So we can summarize the prior example as “transpose, reduce, and transpose
back.”
We can even, at the price of tolerating the as-yet-vague idea of vector spaces
being “the same,” use Gauss’s Method to ﬁnd bases for spans in other types of
vector spaces.
3.9 Example To get a basis for the span of{x2 +x4,2x2 +3x4, −x2 −3x4 } in
the space P4, think of these three polynomials as “the same” as the row vectors
(0 0 1 0 1), (0 0 2 0 3), and (0 0 −1 0 −3), apply Gauss’s Method





0 0 0 0 0


and translate back to get the basis⟨x2 +x4,x4⟩. (As mentioned earlier, we will
make the phrase “the same” precise at the start of the next chapter.)
Section III. Basis and Dimension 139
Thus, the ﬁrst point for this subsection is that the tools of this chapter give
us a more conceptual understanding of Gaussian reduction.
For the second point observe that row operations on a matrix can change its
column space. (
1 2
2 4
)
−2ρ1+ρ2
−→
(
1 2
0 0
)
The column space of the left-hand matrix contains vectors with a second compo-
nent that is nonzero but the column space of the right-hand matrix contains
only vectors whose second component is zero, so the two spaces are diﬀerent.
This observation makes next result surprising.
3.10 Lemma Row operations do not change the column rank.
Proof Restated, ifA reduces toB then the column rank ofB equals the column
rank ofA.
This proof will be ﬁnished if we show that row operations do not aﬀect linear
relationships among columns, because the column rank is the size of the largest
set of unrelated columns. That is, we will show that a relationship exists among
columns (such as that the ﬁfth column is twice the second plus the fourth) if and
only if that relationship exists after the row operation. But this is exactly the
ﬁrst theorem of this book, Theorem One.I.1.5: in a relationship among columns,



row operations leave unchanged the set of solutions(c1,...,c n). QED
Another way to make the point that Gauss’s Method has something to say
about the column space as well as about the row space is with Gauss-Jordan
reduction. It ends with the reduced echelon form of a matrix, as here.



Consider the row space and the column space of this result.
The ﬁrst point made earlier in this subsection says that to get a basis for the
row space we can just collect the rows with leading entries. However, because
this is in reduced echelon form, a basis for the column space is just as easy: collect
the columns containing the leading entries,⟨⃗e1, ⃗e2⟩. Thus, for a reduced echelon
140 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
form matrix we can ﬁnd bases for the row and column spaces in essentially the
same way, by taking the parts of the matrix, the rows or columns, containing
the leading entries.
3.11 Theorem For any matrix, the row rank and column rank are equal.
Proof Bring the matrix to reduced echelon form. Then the row rank equals
the number of leading entries since that equals the number of nonzero rows.
Then also, the number of leading entries equals the column rank because the
set of columns containing leading entries consists of some of the⃗ei’s from a
standard basis, and that set is linearly independent and spans the set of columns.
Hence, in the reduced echelon form matrix, the row rank equals the column
rank, because each equals the number of leading entries.
But Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.10 show that the row rank and column rank
are not changed by using row operations to get to reduced echelon form. Thus
the row rank and the column rank of the original matrix are also equal.QED
3.12 DeﬁnitionThe rank of a matrix is its row rank or column rank.
So the second point that we have made in this subsection is that the column
space and row space of a matrix have the same dimension.
Our ﬁnal point is that the concepts that we’ve seen arising naturally in the
study of vector spaces are exactly the ones that we have studied with linear
systems.
3.13 Theorem For linear systems withn unknowns and with matrix of coeﬃcients
A, the statements
(1) the rank ofA isr
(2) the vector space of solutions of the associated homogeneous system has
dimensionn −r
are equivalent.
So if the system has at least one particular solution then for the set of solutions,
the number of parameters equalsn −r, the number of variables minus the rank
of the matrix of coeﬃcients.
Proof The rank ofA isr if and only if Gaussian reduction onA ends withr
nonzero rows. That’s true if and only if echelon form matrices row equivalent
toA haver-many leading variables. That in turn holds if and only if there are
n −r free variables. QED
Section III. Basis and Dimension 141
3.14 Corollary Where the matrixA isn×n, these statements
(1) the rank ofA isn
(2) A is nonsingular
(3) the rows ofA form a linearly independent set
(4) the columns ofA form a linearly independent set
(5) any linear system whose matrix of coeﬃcients isA has one and only one
solution
are equivalent.
Proof Clearly (1) ⇐⇒ (2) ⇐⇒ (3) ⇐⇒ (4). The last,(4) ⇐⇒ (5), holds
because a set ofn column vectors is linearly independent if and only if it is a
basis for Rn, but the system

has a unique solution for all choices ofd1,...,d n∈ R if and only if the vectors
ofa’s on the left form a basis. QED
3.15 Remark [Munkres] Sometimes the results of this subsection are mistakenly
remembered to say that the general solution of anm equations,n unknowns
system usesn −m parameters. The number of equations is not the relevant
number; rather, what matters is the number of independent equations, the num-
ber of equations in a maximal independent set. Where there arer independent
equations, the general solution involvesn −r parameters.

III.4 Combining Subspaces
This subsection is optional. It is required only for the last sections of
Chapter Three and Chapter Five and for occasional exercises. You can
pass it over without loss of continuity.
One way to understand something is to see how to build it from component
parts. For instance, we sometimes think ofR3 put together from thex-axis,
they-axis, andz-axis. In this subsection we will describe how to decompose a
vector space into a combination of some of its subspaces. In developing this idea
of subspace combination, we will keep theR3 example in mind as a prototype.
Subspacesaresubsetsandsetscombineviaunion. Buttakingthecombination
operation for subspaces to be the simple set union operation isn’t what we want.
For instance, the union of thex-axis, they-axis, andz-axis is not all ofR3. In
fact this union is not a subspace because it is not closed under addition: this
vector 

1
0
0

 +


0


 =





is in none of the three axes and hence is not in the union. Therefore to combine
subspaces, in addition to the members of those subspaces, we must at least also
include all of their linear combinations.
4.1 DeﬁnitionWhereW1,...,W k are subspaces of a vector space, theirsum is
the span of their unionW1 +W2 +··· +Wk = [W1∪W2∪··· Wk].
Writing ‘+’ ﬁts with the conventional practice of using this symbol for a natural
accumulation operation.
4.2 Example Our R3 prototype works with this. Any vector⃗w∈ R3 is a linear
combinationc1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2 +c3⃗v3 where ⃗v1 is a member of thex-axis, etc., in this
way 

w1


and sox-axis +y-axis +z-axis = R3.
4.3 Example A sum of subspaces can be less than the entire space. Inside ofP4,
letL be the subspace of linear polynomials{a +bx |a,b∈ R } and letC be the
subspace of purely-cubic polynomials{cx3 |c∈ R }. ThenL +C is not all ofP4.
Instead,L +C = {a +bx +cx3 |a,b,c ∈ R }.
4.4 Example A space can be described as a combination of subspaces in more
than one way. Besides the decompositionR3 =x-axis +y-axis +z-axis, we can
Section III. Basis and Dimension 145
also write R3 =xy-plane +yz-plane. To check this, note that any⃗w∈ R3 can
be written as a linear combination of a member of thexy-plane and a member
of theyz-plane; here are two such combinations.

The above deﬁnition gives one way in which we can think of a space as a
combination of some of its parts. However, the prior example shows that there is
at least one interesting property of our benchmark model that is not captured by
the deﬁnition of the sum of subspaces. In the familiar decomposition ofR3, we
often speak of a vector’s ‘x part’ or ‘y part’ or ‘z part’. That is, in our prototype
each vector has a unique decomposition into pieces from the parts making up
the whole space. But in the decomposition used in Example 4.4, we cannot refer
to the “xy part” of a vector—these three sums


1
2
3

 =







all describe the vector as comprised of something from the ﬁrst plane plus
something from the second plane, but the “xy part” is diﬀerent in each.
That is, when we consider howR3 is put together from the three axes we
might mean “in such a way that every vector has at least one decomposition,”
which gives the deﬁnition above. But if we take it to mean “in such a way
that every vector has one and only one decomposition” then we need another
condition on combinations. To see what this condition is, recall that vectors are
uniquely represented in terms of a basis. We can use this to break a space into a
sum of subspaces such that any vector in the space breaks uniquely into a sum
of members of those subspaces.
4.5 Example Consider R3 with its standard basisE3 =⟨⃗e1, ⃗e2, ⃗e3⟩. The subspace
with the basisB1 =⟨⃗e1⟩ is thex-axis, the subspace with the basisB2 =⟨⃗e2⟩ is
they-axis, and the subspace with the basisB3 =⟨⃗e3⟩ is thez-axis. The fact
that any member ofR3 is expressible as a sum of vectors from these subspaces

has a solution for anyx,y,z ∈ R. And the fact that each such expression is
unique reﬂects that fact thatE3 is linearly independent, so any equation like
the one above has a unique solution.
4.6 Example We don’t have to take the basis vectors one at a time, we can
conglomerate them into larger sequences. Consider again the spaceR3 and the
vectors from the standard basisE3. The subspace with the basisB1 =⟨⃗e1, ⃗e3⟩
is thexz-plane. The subspace with the basisB2 =⟨⃗e2⟩ is they-axis. As in the
prior example, the fact that any member of the space is a sum of members of
the two subspaces in one and only one way

4.8 Lemma Let V be a vector space that is the sum of some of its subspaces
V =W1 +··· +Wk. LetB1, ..., Bk be bases for these subspaces. The following
are equivalent.
(1) The expression of any⃗v∈V as a combination⃗v = ⃗w1 +··· + ⃗wk with
⃗wi∈Wi is unique.
(2) The concatenationB1
⌢
···
⌢
Bk is a basis forV.
(3) Among nonzero vectors from diﬀerentWi’s every linear relationship is
trivial.
Proof We will show that(1) =⇒ (2), that (2) =⇒ (3), and ﬁnally that
(3) =⇒ (1). For these arguments, observe that we can pass from a combination
of ⃗w’s to a combination of⃗β’s
d1 ⃗w1 +··· +dk ⃗wk =d1(c1,1⃗β1,1 +··· +c1,n1
⃗β1,n1 )
+··· +dk(ck,1⃗βk,1 +··· +ck,nk
⃗βk,nk )
=d1c1,1· ⃗β1,1 +··· +dkck,nk· ⃗βk,nk (∗)
Section III. Basis and Dimension 147
and vice versa (we can move from the bottom to the top by taking eachdi to
be1).
For(1) =⇒ (2), assume that all decompositions are unique. We will show
that B1
⌢
···
⌢
Bk spans the space and is linearly independent. It spans the
space because the assumption thatV = W1 +··· +Wk means that every ⃗v
can be expressed as⃗v = ⃗w1 +··· + ⃗wk, which translates by equation (∗) to an
expression of⃗v as a linear combination of the⃗β’s from the concatenation. For
linear independence, consider this linear relationship.
⃗0 =c1,1⃗β1,1 +··· +ck,nk
⃗βk,nk
Regroup as in (∗) (that is, move from bottom to top) to get the decomposition
⃗0 = ⃗w1 +··· + ⃗wk. Because the zero vector obviously has the decomposition
⃗0 = ⃗0 +··· + ⃗0, the assumption that decompositions are unique shows that each
⃗wi is the zero vector. This means thatci,1⃗βi,1 +··· +ci,ni
⃗βi,ni = ⃗0, and since
eachBi is a basis we have the desired conclusion that all of thec’s are zero.
For(2) =⇒ (3) assume that the concatenation of the bases is a basis for the
entire space. Consider a linear relationship among nonzero vectors from diﬀerent
Wi’s. This might or might not involve a vector fromW1, or one fromW2, etc.,
so we write it⃗0 =··· +di ⃗wi +··· . As in equation (∗) expand the vector.
⃗0 =··· +di(ci,1⃗βi,1 +··· +ci,ni
⃗βi,ni ) +···
=··· +dici,1· ⃗βi,1 +··· +dici,ni· ⃗βi,ni +···
The linear independence ofB1
⌢
···
⌢
Bk gives that each coeﬃcientdici,j is zero.
Since ⃗wi is nonzero vector, at least one of theci,j’s is not zero, and thusdi is
zero. This holds for eachdi, and therefore the linear relationship is trivial.
Finally, for (3) =⇒ (1), assume that among nonzero vectors from diﬀerent
Wi’s any linear relationship is trivial. Consider two decompositions of a vector
⃗v =··· + ⃗wi +··· and ⃗v =··· + ⃗uj +··· where ⃗wi∈Wi and ⃗uj∈Wj. Subtract
one from the other to get a linear relationship, something like this (if there is no
⃗ui or ⃗wj then leave those out).
⃗0 =··· + ( ⃗wi − ⃗ui) +··· + ( ⃗wj − ⃗uj) +···
The case assumption that statement (3) holds implies that the terms each equal
the zero vector⃗wi − ⃗ui = ⃗0. Hence decompositions are unique. QED
4.9 Deﬁnition A collection of subspaces {W1,...,W k } is independent if no
nonzero vector from anyWi is a linear combination of vectors from the other
subspacesW1,...,W i−1,Wi+1,...,W k.
148 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
4.10 DeﬁnitionA vector spaceV is the direct sum (or internal direct sum)
of its subspacesW1,...,W k if V = W1 +W2 +··· +Wk and the collection
{W1,...,W k } is independent. We writeV =W1⊕W2⊕···⊕ Wk.
4.11 Example Our prototype works:R3 =x-axis⊕y-axis⊕z-axis.
4.12 Example The space of2×2 matrices is this direct sum.

(

|b∈ R }⊕ {
(

|c∈ R }
It is the direct sum of subspaces in many other ways as well; direct sum
decompositions are not unique.
4.13 Corollary The dimension of a direct sum is the sum of the dimensions of its
summands.
Proof In Lemma 4.8, the number of basis vectors in the concatenation equals
the sum of the number of vectors in the sub-bases. QED
The special case of two subspaces is worth its own mention.
4.14 DeﬁnitionWhen a vector space is the direct sum of two of its subspaces
then they arecomplements.
4.15 Lemma A vector spaceV is the direct sum of two of its subspacesW1 and
W2 if and only if it is the sum of the twoV =W1 +W2 and their intersection
is trivialW1∩W2 = {⃗0 }.
Proof Suppose ﬁrst thatV =W1⊕W2. By deﬁnition,V is the sum of the
twoV =W1 +W2. To show that their intersection is trivial let⃗v be a vector
fromW1∩W2 and consider the equation⃗v = ⃗v. On that equation’s left side is
a member ofW1 and on the right is a member ofW2, which we can think of as
a linear combination of members ofW2. But the two spaces are independent so
the only way that a member ofW1 can be a linear combination of vectors from
W2 is if that member is the zero vector⃗v = ⃗0.
For the other direction, suppose thatV is the sum of two spaces with a
trivial intersection. To show thatV is a direct sum of the two we need only
show that the spaces are independent—that no nonzero member of the ﬁrst is
expressible as a linear combination of members of the second, and vice versa.
This holds because any relationship⃗w1 =c1 ⃗w2,1 +··· +ck ⃗w2,k (with ⃗w1∈W1
and ⃗w2,j∈W2 for allj) shows that the vector on the left is also inW2, since
the right side is a combination of members ofW2. The intersection of these two
spaces is trivial, so⃗w1 = ⃗0. The same argument works for any⃗w2. QED
Section III. Basis and Dimension 149
4.16 Example In R2 thex-axis and they-axis are complements, that is,R2 =
x-axis⊕y-axis. This points out that subspace complement is slightly diﬀerent
than set complement; thex andy axes are not set complements because their
intersection is not the empty set.
A space can have more than one pair of complementary subspaces; another
pair for R2 are the subspaces consisting of the linesy =x andy =2x.
4.17 Example In the spaceF = {acosθ +bsinθ |a,b∈ R }, the subspacesW1 =
{acosθ |a∈ R } andW2 = {bsinθ |b∈ R } are complements. The prior exam-
ple noted that a space can be decomposed into more than one pair of comple-
ments. In addition note thatF can has more than one pair of complementary
subspaces where the ﬁrst in the pair isW1—another complement ofW1 is
W3 = {bsinθ +bcosθ |b∈ R }.
4.18 Example In R3, thexy-plane and theyz-planes are not complements, which
is the point of the discussion following Example 4.4. One complement of the
xy-plane is thez-axis.
Here is a natural question that arises from Lemma 4.15: fork > 2is the
simple sumV =W1 +··· +Wk also a direct sum if and only if the intersection
of the subspaces is trivial?
4.19 Example If there are more than two subspaces then having a trivial inter-
section is not enough to guarantee unique decomposition (i.e., is not enough to
ensure that the spaces are independent). InR3, letW1 be thex-axis, letW2 be
they-axis, and letW3 be this.
W3 = {


q
q
r

 |q,r∈ R }
The check thatR3 =W1 +W2 +W3 is easy. The intersectionW1∩W2∩W3 is
trivial, but decompositions aren’t unique.

(This example also shows that this requirement is also not enough: that all
pairwise intersections of the subspaces be trivial. See Exercise 30.)
In this subsection we have seen two ways to regard a space as built up from
component parts. Both are useful; in particular we will use the direct sum
deﬁnition at the end of the Chapter Five.

4.31 Prove that ifV =W1⊕... ⊕Wk thenWi∩Wj is trivial wheneveri⁄=j. This
shows that the ﬁrst half of the proof of Lemma 4.15 extends to the case of more
than two subspaces. (Example 4.19 shows that this implication does not reverse;
the other half does not extend.)
4.32 Recall that no linearly independent set contains the zero vector. Can an
independent set of subspaces contain the trivial subspace?
✓ 4.33 Does every subspace have a complement?
✓ 4.34 LetW1,W2 be subspaces of a vector space.
(a) Assume that the setS1 spansW1, and that the setS2 spansW2. CanS1∪S2
spanW1 +W2? Must it?
(b) Assume thatS1 is a linearly independent subset ofW1 and thatS2 is a linearly
independent subset ofW2. Can S1∪S2 be a linearly independent subset of
W1 +W2? Must it?
4.35 When we decompose a vector space as a direct sum, the dimensions of the
subspaces add to the dimension of the space. The situation with a space that is
given as the sum of its subspaces is not as simple. This exercise considers the
two-subspace special case.
(a) For these subspaces ofM2×2 ﬁndW1∩W2, dim(W1∩W2), W1 +W2, and
dim(W1 +W2).

(b) Suppose thatU and W are subspaces of a vector space. Suppose that the
sequence⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βk⟩ is a basis forU∩W. Finally, suppose that the prior
sequence has been expanded to give a sequence⟨⃗µ1,..., ⃗µj, ⃗β1,..., ⃗βk⟩ that is a
basis forU, and a sequence⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βk, ⃗ω1,..., ⃗ωp⟩ that is a basis forW. Prove
that this sequence
⟨⃗µ1,..., ⃗µj, ⃗β1,..., ⃗βk, ⃗ω1,..., ⃗ωp⟩
is a basis for the sumU +W.
(c) Conclude that dim(U +W) = dim(U) +dim(W) −dim(U∩W).
(d) LetW1 andW2 be eight-dimensional subspaces of a ten-dimensional space.
List all values possible for dim(W1∩W2).

For the second one, be careful about the entries on the diagonal.)
(b) What is the relationship between a square symmetric matrix and its transpose?
Between a square antisymmetric matrix and its transpose?
(c) Show that Mn×n is the direct sum of the space of symmetric matrices and the

4.38 LetW1,W2,W3 be subspaces of a vector space. Prove that(W1∩W2) + (W1∩
W3)⊆W1∩ (W2 +W3). Does the inclusion reverse?
152 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
4.39 The example of thex-axis and they-axis in R2 shows thatW1⊕W2 =V does
not imply thatW1∪W2 =V. CanW1⊕W2 =V andW1∪W2 =V happen?
4.40 Consider Corollary 4.13. Does it work both ways—that is, supposing thatV =
W1+··· +Wk, isV =W1⊕···⊕ Wk if and only ifdim(V) = dim(W1)+··· +dim(Wk)?
4.41 We know that ifV =W1⊕W2 then there is a basis forV that splits into a
basis forW1 and a basis forW2. Can we make the stronger statement that every
basis forV splits into a basis forW1 and a basis forW2?
4.42 We can ask about the algebra of the ‘+’ operation.
(a) Is it commutative; isW1 +W2 =W2 +W1?
(b) Is it associative; is(W1 +W2) +W3 =W1 + (W2 +W3)?
(c) LetW be a subspace of some vector space. Show thatW +W =W.
(d) Must there be an identity element, a subspaceI such thatI +W =W +I =W

Fields
Computations involving only integers or only rational numbers are much easier
than those with real numbers. Could other algebraic structures, such as the
integers or the rationals, work in the place ofR in the deﬁnition of a vector
space?
If we take “work” to mean that the results of this chapter remain true then
there is a natural list of conditions that a structure (that is, number system)
must have in order to work in the place ofR. A ﬁeldis a setF with operations
‘+’ and ‘·’ such that
(1) for anya,b∈ F the result ofa +b is in F, anda +b =b +a, and ifc∈ F
thena + (b +c) = (a +b) +c
(2) for anya,b∈ F the result ofa·b is in F, anda·b =b·a, and ifc∈ F then
a· (b·c) = (a·b)·c
(3) ifa,b,c ∈ F thena· (b +c) =a·b +a·c
(4) there is an element0∈ F such that ifa∈ F thena +0 =a, and for each
a∈ F there is an element−a∈ F such that (−a) +a =0
(5) there is an element1∈ F such that ifa∈ F thena·1 =a, and for each
elementa⁄=0 of F there is an elementa−1∈ F such thata−1·a =1.
For example, the algebraic structure consisting of the set of real numbers
along with its usual addition and multiplication operation is a ﬁeld. Another
ﬁeld is the set of rational numbers with its usual addition and multiplication
operations. An example of an algebraic structure that is not a ﬁeld is the integers,
because it fails the ﬁnal condition.
Some examples are more surprising. The setB = {0,1 } under these opera-
tions:
+ 0 1
0 0 1
1 1 0
· 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
is a ﬁeld; see Exercise 4.
154 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
We could in this book develop Linear Algebra as the theory of vector spaces
with scalars from an arbitrary ﬁeld. In that case, almost all of the statements here
would carry over by replacing ‘R’ with ‘F’, that is, by taking coeﬃcients, vector
entries, and matrix entries to be elements ofF (the exceptions are statements
involving distances or angles, which would need additional development). Here
are some examples; each applies to a vector spaceV over a ﬁeldF.
∗ For any⃗v∈V anda∈ F, (i)0·⃗v = ⃗0, (ii) −1·⃗v +⃗v = ⃗0, and (iii)a·⃗0 = ⃗0.
∗ The span, the set of linear combinations, of a subset ofV is a subspace of
V.
∗ Any subset of a linearly independent set is also linearly independent.
∗ In a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space, any two bases have the same number
of elements.
(Even statements that don’t explicitly mentionF use ﬁeld properties in their
proof.)
We will not develop vector spaces in this more general setting because the
additional abstraction can be a distraction. The ideas we want to bring out
already appear when we stick to the reals.
The exception is Chapter Five. There we must factor polynomials, so we
will switch to considering vector spaces over the ﬁeld of complex numbers.

Crystals
Everyone has noticed that table salt comes in little cubes.
This orderly outside arises from an orderly inside—the way the atoms lie is
also cubical, these cubes stack in neat rows and columns, and the salt faces tend
to be just an outer layer of cubes. One cube of atoms is shown below. Salt is
sodium chloride and the small spheres shown are sodium while the big ones are
chloride. To simplify the view, it only shows the sodiums and chlorides on the
front, top, and right.
The specks of salt that we see above have many repetitions of this fundamental
unit. A solid, such as table salt, with a regular internal structure is acrystal.
We can restrict our attention to the front face. There we have a square
repeated many times giving a lattice of atoms.
156 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
The distance along the sides of each square cell is about3.34 Ångstroms (an
Ångstrom is10−10 meters). When we want to refer to atoms in the lattice that
number is unwieldy, and so we take the square’s side length as a unit. That is,
we naturally adopt this basis.
⟨

3.34

)
,
(

)
⟩
Now we can describe, say, the atom in the upper right of the lattice picture
above as3⃗β1 +2⃗β2, instead of10.02 Ångstroms over and6.68 up.
Another crystal from everyday experience is pencil lead. It isgraphite,
formed from carbon atoms arranged in this shape.
This is a single plane of graphite, calledgraphene. A piece of graphite consists of
many of these planes, layered. The chemical bonds between the planes are much
weaker than the bonds inside the planes, which explains why pencils write—the
graphite can be sheared so that the planes slide oﬀ and are left on the paper.
We can get a convenient unit of length by decomposing the hexagonal ring
into three regions that are rotations of thisunit cell.
The vectors that form the sides of that unit cell make a convenient basis. The
distance along the bottom and slant is1.42 Ångstroms, so this

is a good basis.
Another familiar crystal formed from carbon is diamond. Like table salt it
is built from cubes but the structure inside each cube is more complicated. In
addition to carbons at each corner,
there are carbons in the middle of each face.
(To show the new face carbons clearly, the corner carbons are reduced to dots.)
There are also four more carbons inside the cube, two that are a quarter of the
way up from the bottom and two that are a quarter of the way down from the
top.
(As before, carbons shown earlier are reduced here to dots.) The distance along
any edge of the cube is2.18 Ångstroms. Thus, a natural basis for describing the
locations of the carbons and the bonds between them, is this.

The examples here show that the structures of crystals is complicated enough
to need some organized system to give the locations of the atoms and how they
are chemically bound. One tool for that organization is a convenient basis. This
application of bases is simple but it shows a science context where the idea arises
naturally.

ruler, we can estimate that face is a square that is0.1 cm on a side.)

2 In the graphite picture, imagine that we are interested in a point5.67 Ångstroms
over and3.14 Ångstroms up from the origin.
(a) Express that point in terms of the basis given for graphite.
(b) How many hexagonal shapes away is this point from the origin?
(c) Express that point in terms of a second basis, where the ﬁrst basis vector is
the same, but the second is perpendicular to the ﬁrst (going up the plane) and

3 Give the locations of the atoms in the diamond cube both in terms of the basis,
and in Ångstroms.
4 This illustrates how we could compute the dimensions of a unit cell from the

(a) Recall that there are6.022×1023 atoms in a mole (this is Avogadro’s number).
From that, and the fact that platinum has a mass of195.08 grams per mole,
calculate the mass of each atom.
(b) Platinum crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice with atoms at each lattice

Voting Paradoxes
Imagine that a Political Science class studying the American presidential process
holds a mock election. The 29 class members rank the Democratic Party,
Republican Party, and Third Party nominees, from most preferred to least
preferred (> means ‘is preferred to’).

What is the preference of the group as a whole?
Overall, the group prefers the Democrat to the Republican by ﬁve votes;
seventeen voters ranked the Democrat above the Republican versus twelve the
other way. And the group prefers the Republican to the Third’s nominee, ﬁfteen
to fourteen. But, strangely enough, the group also prefers the Third to the
Democrat, eighteen to eleven.
Democrat
Third Republican
7 voters
1 voter
5 voters
This is avoting paradox, speciﬁcally, amajority cycle.
Mathematicians study voting paradoxes in part because of their implications
for practical politics. For instance, the instructor can manipulate this class into
160 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
choosing the Democrat as the overall winner by ﬁrst asking for a vote between
the Republican and the Third, and then asking for a vote between the winner
of that contest, who will be the Republican, and the Democrat. By similar
manipulations the instructor can make any of the other two candidates come out
as the winner. (We will stick to three-candidate elections but the same thing
happens in larger elections.)
Mathematicians also study voting paradoxes simply because they are inter-
esting. One interesting aspect is that the group’s overall majority cycle occurs
despite that each single voter’s preference list isrational, in a straight-line order.
That is, the majority cycle seems to arise in the aggregate without being present
in the components of that aggregate, the preference lists. However we can use
linear algebra to argue that a tendency toward cyclic preference is actually
present in each voter’s list and that it surfaces when there is more adding of the
tendency than canceling.
For this, abbreviating the choices asD, R, andT, we can describe how a
voter with preference orderD>R>T contributes to the above cycle.
D
T R
−1 voter
1 voter
1 voter
(The negative sign is here because the arrow describesT as preferred toD, but
this voter likes them the other way.) The descriptions for the other preference
lists are in the table on page 162.
Now, to conduct the election we linearly combine these descriptions; for
instance, the Political Science mock election

yields the circular group preference shown earlier.
Of course, taking linear combinations is linear algebra. The graphical cycle
notation is suggestive but inconvenient so we use column vectors by starting at
theD and taking the numbers from the cycle in counterclockwise order. Thus,
we represent the mock election and a singleD>R>T vote in this way.

We can represent votes with respect to this basis, and thereby decompose them
into a cyclic part and an acyclic part.(Note for readers who have covered the

We say that the ﬁrst voter has positivespin since the cycle part is with the
direction that we have chosen for the arrows, while the second voter’s spin is
negative.
The fact that these opposite voters cancel each other is reﬂected in the fact
that their vote vectors add to zero. This suggests an alternate way to tally an
election. We could ﬁrst cancel as many opposite preference lists as possible and
then determine the outcome by adding the remaining lists.
The table below contains the three pairs of opposite preference lists. For
instance, the top line contains the voters discussed above.

If we conduct the election as just described then after the cancellation of as many
opposite pairs of voters as possible there will remain three sets of preference
lists: one set from the ﬁrst row, one from the second row, and one from the third
row. We will ﬁnish by proving that a voting paradox can happen only if the
spins of these three sets are in the same direction. That is, for a voting paradox
to occur the three remaining sets must all come from the left of the table or all
come from the right (see Exercise 3). This shows that there is some connection
Topic: Voting Paradoxes 163
between the majority cycle and the decomposition that we are using—a voting
paradox can happen only when the tendencies toward cyclic preference reinforce
each other.
For the proof, assume that we have canceled opposite preference orders and
are left with one set of preference lists for each of the three rows. Consider the
ﬁrst row’s remaining preference lists. They could be from the ﬁrst row’s left or
right (or between, since the lists could have canceled exactly). We shall write
D
T R
−a
a
a
wherea is an integer that is positive if the remaining lists are on the left, where
a is negative if the lists are on the right, and zero if the cancellation was perfect.
Similarly we have integersb andc for the second and third rows, which can
each be positive, negative, or zero.
Then the election is determined by this sum.

A voting paradox occurs when the three numbers in the total cycle on the right,
−a +b +c anda −b +c anda +b −c, are all nonnegative or all nonpositive. We
will prove this occurs only when either all three ofa,b, andc are nonnegative
or all three are nonpositive.
Let the total cycle numbers be nonnegative; the other case is similar.
−a +b +c >0
a −b +c >0
a +b −c >0
Add the ﬁrst two rows to see thatc >0. Add the ﬁrst and third rows forb >0.
And, the second and third rows together givea >0. Thus if the total cycle is
nonnegative then in each row the remaining preference lists are from the table’s
left. That ends the proof.
This result says only that having all three spin in the same direction is a
necessary condition for a majority cycle. It is not suﬃcient; see Exercise 4.
Voting theory and associated topics are the subject of current research. There
are many intriguing results, notably those produced by K Arrow [Arrow] who
won the Nobel Prize in part for this work, showing that no voting system is
entirely fair (for a reasonable deﬁnition of “fair”). Some good introductory arti-
cles are [Gardner, 1970], [Gardner, 1974], [Gardner, 1980], and [Neimi & Riker].
[Taylor] is a readable text. The long list of cases from recent American political
164 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
history in [Poundstone] shows these paradoxes are routinely manipulated in
practice. (On the other hand, quite recent research shows that computing how
to manipulate elections can in general be unfeasible, but this is beyond our
scope.) This Topic is drawn from [Zwicker]. (Author’s Note: I would like to
thank Professor Zwicker for his kind and illuminating discussions.)
Exercises
1 Here is a reasonable way in which a voter could have a cyclic preference. Suppose
that this voter ranks each candidate on each of three criteria.
(a) Draw up a table with the rows labeled ‘Democrat’, ‘Republican’, and ‘Third’,
and the columns labeled ‘character’, ‘experience’, and ‘policies’. Inside each
column, rank some candidate as most preferred, rank another as in the middle,
and rank the remaining one as least preferred.
(b) In this ranking, is the Democrat preferred to the Republican in (at least) two
out of three criteria, or vice versa? Is the Republican preferred to the Third?
(c) Does the table that was just constructed have a cyclic preference order? If
not, make one that does.
So it is possible for a voter to have a cyclic preference among candidates. The
paradox described above, however, is that even if each voter has a straight-line
preference list, a cyclic preference can still arise for the entire group.
2 Compute the values in the table of decompositions.
3 Perform the cancellations of opposite preference orders for the Political Science
class’s mock election. Are all the remaining preferences from the left three rows of
the table or from the right?
4 The necessary condition that a voting paradox can happen only if all three
preference lists remaining after cancellation have the same spin is not also suﬃ-
cient.
(a) Give an example of a vote where there is a majority cycle and addition of one
more voter with the same spin causes the cycle to go away.
(b) Can the opposite happen; can addition of one voter with a “wrong” spin cause
a cycle to appear?
(c) Give a condition that is both necessary and suﬃcient to get a majority cycle.
5 A one-voter election cannot have a majority cycle because of the requirement that
we’ve imposed that the voter’s list must be rational.
(a) Show that a two-voter election may have a majority cycle. (We consider the
group preference a majority cycle if all three group totals are nonnegative or if
all three are nonpositive—that is, we allow some zero’s in the group preference.)
(b) Show that for any number of voters greater than one, there is an election
involving that many voters that results in a majority cycle.
6 LetU be a subspace ofR3. Prove that the setU⊥ = {⃗v | ⃗v•⃗u =0 for all ⃗u∈U }
of vectors that are perpendicular to each vector inU is also subspace ofR3. Does
this hold ifU is not a subspace?

To start, consider the falling body equationdistance =16· (time)2. If the
distance is in feet and the time is in seconds then this is a true statement.
However it is not correct in other unit systems, such as meters and seconds,
because16 isn’t the right constant in those systems. We can ﬁx that by attaching
units to the16, making it adimensional constant.
dist =16 ft
sec2· (time)2
Now the equation holds also in the meter-second system because when we align
the units (a foot is approximately0.30 meters),
distance in meters=160.30m
sec2 · (time in sec)2 =4.8 m
sec2· (time in sec)2
the constant gets adjusted. So in order to have equations that are correct across
unit systems, we restrict our attention to those that use dimensional constants.
Such an equation iscomplete.
Moving away from a particular unit system allows us to just measure quan-
tities in combinations of some units of lengthL, massM, and timeT. These
three are ourphysical dimensions. For instance, we could measure velocity in
feet/second or fathoms/hour but at all events it involves a unit of length divided
by a unit of time so thedimensional formula of velocity isL/T. Similarly,
density’s dimensional formula isM/L3.
166 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
To write the dimensional formula we shall use negative exponents instead of
fractions and we shall include the dimensions with a zero exponent. Thus we
will write the dimensional formula of velocity asL1M0T −1 and that of density
asL−3M1T0.
With that, “you can’t add apples and oranges” becomes the advice to check
that all of an equation’s terms have the same dimensional formula. An example
is this version of the falling body equationd −gt2 =0. The dimensional formula
of thed term isL1M0T0. For the other term, the dimensional formula ofg
isL1M0T −2 (g is given above as16ft/sec2) and the dimensional formula oft
is L0M0T1 so that of the entiregt2 term isL1M0T −2(L0M0T1)2 =L1M0T0.
Thus the two terms have the same dimensional formula. An equation with this
property isdimensionally homogeneous.
Quantities with dimensional formulaL0M0T0 are dimensionless. For ex-
ample, we measure an angle by taking the ratio of the subtended arc to the
radius
r
arc
which is the ratio of a length to a length(L1M0T0)(L1M0T0)−1 and thus angles
have the dimensional formulaL0M0T0.
The classic example of using the units for more than bookkeeping, using
them to draw conclusions, considers the formula for the period of a pendulum.
p = –some expression involving the length of the string, etc.–
The period is in units of timeL0M0T1. So the quantities on the other side of
the equation must have dimensional formulas that combine in such a way that
theirL’s andM’s cancel and only a singleT remains. The table on page 167 has
the quantities that an experienced investigator would consider possibly relevant
to the period of a pendulum. The only dimensional formulas involvingL are for
the length of the string and the acceleration due to gravity. For theL’s of these
two to cancel when they appear in the equation they must be in ratio, e.g., as
(𝓁/g)2, or as cos(𝓁/g), or as(𝓁/g)−1. Therefore the period is a function of𝓁/g.
This is a remarkable result: with a pencil and paper analysis, before we ever
took out the pendulum and made measurements, we have determined something
about what makes up its period.
To do dimensional analysis systematically, we need two facts (arguments
for these are in [Bridgman], Chapter II and IV). The ﬁrst is that each equation
relating physical quantities that we shall see involves a sum of terms, where each
term has the form
mp1
1 mp2
2 ··· mpk
k
Topic: Dimensional Analysis 167
for numbersm1, ..., mk that measure the quantities.
For the second fact, observe that an easy way to construct a dimensionally
homogeneous expression is by taking a product of dimensionless quantities
or by adding such dimensionless terms. Buckingham’s Theorem states that
any complete relationship among quantities with dimensional formulas can be
algebraically manipulated into a form where there is some functionf such that
f(Π1,...,Π n) =0
for a complete set{Π1,...,Π n } of dimensionless products. (The ﬁrst example
below describes what makes a set of dimensionless products ‘complete’.) We
usually want to express one of the quantities,m1 for instance, in terms of the
others. For that we will assume that the above equality can be rewritten
m1 =m−p2
2 ··· m−pk
k · ˆf(Π2,...,Π n)
where Π1 = m1mp2
2 ··· mpk
k is dimensionless and the productsΠ2, ..., Πn
don’t involvem1 (as withf, hereˆf is an arbitrary function, this time ofn −1
arguments). Thus, to do dimensional analysis we should ﬁnd which dimensionless
products are possible.
For example, again consider the formula for a pendulum’s period.

period p L0M0T1
length of string𝓁 L1M0T0
mass of bobm L0M1T0
acceleration due to gravityg L1M0T −2
arc of swingθ L0M0T0
By the ﬁrst fact cited above, we expect the formula to have (possibly sums of
terms of) the formpp1𝓁p2mp3gp4θp5. To use the second fact, to ﬁnd which
combinations of the powersp1, ..., p5 yield dimensionless products, consider
this equation.
(L0M0T1)p1 (L1M0T0)p2 (L0M1T0)p3 (L1M0T −2)p4 (L0M0T0)p5 =L0M0T0
It gives three conditions on the powers.
p2 + p4 =0
p3 =0
p1 −2p4 =0
168 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
Note thatp3 =0 so the mass of the bob does not aﬀect the period. Gaussian
reduction and parametrization of that system gives this

(we’ve takenp1 as one of the parameters in order to express the period in terms
of the other quantities).
The set of dimensionless products contains all termspp1𝓁p2mp3ap4θp5
subject to the conditions above. This set forms a vector space under the ‘+’
operation of multiplying two such products and the ‘·’ operation of raising such
a product to the power of the scalar (see Exercise 5). The term ‘complete set of
dimensionless products’ in Buckingham’s Theorem means a basis for this vector
space.
We can get a basis by ﬁrst takingp1 =1,p5 =0, and then takingp1 =0,
p5 =1. The associated dimensionless products areΠ1 =p𝓁−1/2g1/2 andΠ2 =θ.
Because the set{Π1,Π2 } is complete, Buckingham’s Theorem says that
p =𝓁1/2g−1/2· ˆf(θ) =
√
𝓁/g· ˆf(θ)
where ˆf is a function that we cannot determine from this analysis (a ﬁrst year
physics text will show by other means that for small angles it is approximately
the constant functionˆf(θ) =2π).
Thus, analysis of the relationships that are possible between the quantities
with the given dimensional formulas has given us a fair amount of information: a
pendulum’s period does not depend on the mass of the bob, and it rises with
the square root of the length of the string.
For the next example we try to determine the period of revolution of two
bodies in space orbiting each other under mutual gravitational attraction. An
experienced investigator could expect that these are the relevant quantities.

As earlier, the set of dimensionless products of these quantities forms a
vector space and we want to produce a basis for that space, a ‘complete’ set of
dimensionless products. One such set, gotten from settingp1 =1 andp4 =0
and also settingp1 =0 andp4 =1 is {Π1 =pr−3/2m1/2
1 G1/2,Π 2 =m−1
1 m2 }.
With that, Buckingham’s Theorem says that any complete relationship among

Remark. An important application of the prior formula is whenm1 is the
mass of the sun andm2 is the mass of a planet. Becausem1 is very much greater
thanm2, the argument toˆf is approximately0, and we can wonder whether
this part of the formula remains approximately constant asm2 varies. One way
to see that it does is this. The sun is so much larger than the planet that the
mutual rotation is approximately about the sun’s center. If we vary the planet’s
massm2 by a factor ofx (e.g., Venus’s mass isx =0.815 times Earth’s mass),
then the force of attraction is multiplied byx, andx times the force acting on
x times the mass gives, sinceF =ma, the same acceleration, about the same
center (approximately). Hence, the orbit will be the same and so its period
will be the same, and thus the right side of the above equation also remains
unchanged (approximately). Therefore,ˆf(m2/m1) is approximately constant as
m2 varies. This is Kepler’s Third Law: the square of the period of a planet is
proportional to the cube of the mean radius of its orbit about the sun.
The ﬁnal example was one of the ﬁrst explicit applications of dimensional
analysis. Lord Raleigh considered the speed of a wave in deep water and
suggested these as the relevant quantities.

The three examples above show that dimensional analysis can bring us far
toward expressing the relationship among the quantities. For further reading,
the classic reference is [Bridgman]—this brief book is delightful. Another source
is [Giordano, Wells, Wilde]. A description of dimensional analysis’s place in
modeling is in [Giordano, Jaye, Weir].

Maps Between Spaces
I Isomorphisms
In the examples following the deﬁnition of a vector space we expressed the
intuition that some spaces are “the same” as others. For instance, the space of
two-tall column vectors and the space of two-wide row vectors are not equal
because their elements—column vectors and row vectors—are not equal, but
we feel that these spaces diﬀer only in how their elements appear. We will now
make this precise.
This section illustrates a common phase of a mathematical investigation.
With the help of some examples we’ve gotten an idea. We will next give a formal
deﬁnition and then we will produce some results backing our contention that
the deﬁnition captures the idea. We’ve seen this happen already, for instance in
the ﬁrst section of the Vector Space chapter. There, the study of linear systems
led us to consider collections closed under linear combinations. We deﬁned such
a collection as a vector space and we followed it with some supporting results.
That wasn’t an end point, instead it led to new insights such as the idea of a
basis. Here also, after producing a deﬁnition and supporting it, we will get two
surprises (pleasant ones). First, we will ﬁnd that the deﬁnition applies to some
unforeseen, and interesting, cases. Second, the study of the deﬁnition will lead
to new ideas. In this way, our investigation will build momentum.
I.1 Definition and Examples
We start with two examples that suggest the right deﬁnition.
174 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
1.1 Example The space of two-wide row vectors and the space of two-tall column
vectors are “the same” in that if we associate the vectors that have the same
components, e.g.,
(1 2) ←→
(
1
2
)
(read the double arrow as “corresponds to”) then this association respects the
operations. For instance these corresponding vectors add to corresponding totals
(1 2) + (3 4) = (4 6) ←→
(
1
2
)
+
(
3
4
)
=
(
4
6
)
and here is an example of the correspondence respecting scalar multiplication.
5· (1 2) = (5 10) ←→ 5·
(
1
2
)
=
(
5
10
)
Stated generally, under the correspondence
(a0 a1) ←→
(
a0
a1
)
both operations are preserved:
(a0 a1) + (b0 b1) = (a0 +b0 a1 +b1)←→
(
a0
a1
)
+
(
b0
b1
)
=
(
a0 +b0
a1 +b1
)
and
r· (a0 a1) = (ra0 ra1) ←→ r·
(
a0
a1
)
=
(
ra0
ra1
)
(all of the variables are scalars).
1.2 Example Another two spaces that we can think of as “the same” areP2, the
space of quadratic polynomials, andR3. A natural correspondence is this.
a0 +a1x +a2x2 ←→

a2

 (e.g.,1 +2x +3x2←→

This preserves structure: corresponding elements add in a corresponding way
a0 +a1x +a2x2
+b0 +b1x +b2x2
(a0 +b0) + (a1 +b1)x + (a2 +b2)x2

1.3 DeﬁnitionAn isomorphism between two vector spacesV andW is a map
f :V→W that
(1) is a correspondence:f is one-to-one and onto;∗
(2) preserves structure:if ⃗v1,⃗v2∈V then
f(⃗v1 + ⃗v2) =f(⃗v1) +f(⃗v2)
and if⃗v∈V andr∈ R then
f(r⃗v) =rf(⃗v)
(we writeV ∼=W, read “V is isomorphic toW”, when such a map exists).
“Morphism” means map, so “isomorphism” means a map expressing sameness.
1.4 Example The vector spaceG = {c1cosθ +c2sinθ |c1,c2∈ R } of functions
ofθ is isomorphic toR2 under this map.
c1cosθ +c2sinθ
f
↦−→
(
c1
c2
)
We will check this by going through the conditions in the deﬁnition. We will
ﬁrst verify condition (1), that the map is a correspondence between the sets
underlying the spaces.
To establish thatf is one-to-one we must prove thatf(⃗a) =f(⃗b) only when
⃗a = ⃗b. If
f(a1cosθ +a2sinθ) =f(b1cosθ +b2sinθ)
then by the deﬁnition off (
a1
a2
)
=
(
b1
b2
)
from which we conclude thata1 =b1 and a2 =b2, because column vectors
are equal only when they have equal components. Thusa1cosθ +a2sinθ =
b1cosθ +b2sinθ, and as required we’ve veriﬁed thatf(⃗a) =f(⃗b) implies that
⃗a = ⃗b.
∗More information on correspondences is in the appendix.
176 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
To prove thatf is onto we must check that any member of the codomainR2
is the image of some member of the domainG. So, consider a member of the
codomain (
x
y
)
and note that it is the image underf ofxcosθ +ysinθ.
Nextwewillverifycondition(2), that fpreservesstructure. Thiscomputation
shows thatf preserves addition.
f
(
(a1cosθ +a2sinθ) + (b1cosθ +b2sinθ)
)
=f
(
(a1 +b1)cosθ + (a2 +b2)sinθ
)
=
(
a1 +b1
a2 +b2
)
=
(
a1
a2
)
+
(
b1
b2
)
=f(a1cosθ +a2sinθ) +f(b1cosθ +b2sinθ)
The computation showing thatf preserves scalar multiplication is similar.
f
(
r· (a1cosθ +a2sinθ)
)
=f(ra1cosθ +ra2sinθ )
=
(
ra1
ra2
)
=r·
(
a1
a2
)
=r· f(a1cosθ +a2sinθ)
With both (1) and (2) veriﬁed, we know thatf is an isomorphism and we
can say that the spaces are isomorphicG ∼= R2.
1.5 Example LetV be the space{c1x +c2y +c3z |c1,c2,c3∈ R } of linear combi-
nations of the three variables under the natural addition and scalar multiplication
operations. ThenV is isomorphic toP2, the space of quadratic polynomials.
To show this we must produce an isomorphism map. There is more than one
possibility; for instance, here are four to choose among.
c1x +c2y +c3z
f1
↦−→ c1 +c2x +c3x2
f2
↦−→ c2 +c3x +c1x2
f3
↦−→ −c1 −c2x −c3x2
f4
↦−→ c1 + (c1 +c2)x + (c1 +c3)x2
Section I. Isomorphisms 177
The ﬁrst map is the more natural correspondence in that it just carries the
coeﬃcients over. However we shall dof2 to underline that there are isomorphisms
other than the obvious one. (Checking thatf1 is an isomorphism is Exercise 14.)
To show thatf2 is one-to-one we will prove that iff2(c1x +c2y +c3z) =
f2(d1x +d2y +d3z) thenc1x +c2y +c3z =d1x +d2y +d3z. The assumption
thatf2(c1x +c2y +c3z) =f2(d1x +d2y +d3z) gives, by the deﬁnition off2, that
c2 +c3x +c1x2 =d2 +d3x +d1x2. Equal polynomials have equal coeﬃcients so
c2 =d2,c3 =d3, andc1 =d1. Hencef2(c1x+c2y+c3z) =f2(d1x+d2y+d3z)
implies thatc1x +c2y +c3z =d1x +d2y +d3z, andf2 is one-to-one.
The mapf2 is onto because a membera +bx +cx2 of the codomain is the
image of a member of the domain, namely it isf2(cx +ay +bz). For instance,
2 +3x −4x2 isf2(−4x +2y +3z).
The computations for structure preservation are like those in the prior
example. The mapf2 preserves addition
f2
(
(c1x +c2y +c3z) + (d1x +d2y +d3z)
)
=f2
(
(c1 +d1)x + (c2 +d2)y + (c3 +d3)z
)
= (c2 +d2) + (c3 +d3)x + (c1 +d1)x2
= (c2 +c3x +c1x2) + (d2 +d3x +d1x2)
=f2(c1x +c2y +c3z) +f2(d1x +d2y +d3z)
and scalar multiplication.
f2
(
r· (c1x +c2y +c3z)
)
=f2(rc1x +rc2y +rc3z)
=rc2 +rc3x +rc1x2
=r· (c2 +c3x +c1x2)
=r· f2(c1x +c2y +c3z)
Thusf2 is an isomorphism. We writeV ∼= P2.
1.6 Example Every space is isomorphic to itself under the identity map. The
check is easy.
1.7 DeﬁnitionAn automorphism is an isomorphism of a space with itself.
1.8 Example Adilation mapds : R2→ R2 that multiplies all vectors by a nonzero
scalars is an automorphism ofR2.

Another automorphism is arotation or turning map,tθ : R2→ R2 that rotates
all vectors through an angleθ.
⃗u
tπ/6(⃗u)tπ/6
−→
A third type of automorphism ofR2 is a mapf𝓁 : R2→ R2 that ﬂipsor reﬂects
all vectors over a line𝓁 through the origin.
𝓁 ⃗u
f𝓁(⃗u)
f𝓁
−→
Checking that these are automorphisms is Exercise 33.
1.9 Example Consider the spaceP5 of polynomials of degree5 or less and the
mapf that sends a polynomialp(x) top(x −1). For instance, under this map
x2↦→ (x −1)2 =x2 −2x +1 andx3 +2x↦→ (x −1)3 +2(x −1) =x3 −3x2 +5x −3.
This map is an automorphism of this space; the check is Exercise 25.
This isomorphism ofP5 with itself does more than just tell us that the space
is “the same” as itself. It gives us some insight into the space’s structure. Below
is a family of parabolas, graphs of members ofP5. Each has a vertex aty = −1,
and the left-most one has zeroes at−2.25 and −1.75, the next one has zeroes at
−1.25 and −0.75, etc.
p0 p1
Substitution ofx −1 forx in any function’s argument shifts its graph to the
right by one. Thus,f(p0) = p1, andf’s action is to shift all of the parabolas
to the right by one. Notice that the picture beforef is applied is the same as
the picture afterf is applied because while each parabola moves to the right,
another one comes in from the left to take its place. This also holds true for
cubics, etc. So the automorphismf expresses the idea thatP5 has a certain
horizontal-homogeneity: if we draw two pictures showing all members ofP5, one

picture centered atx =0 and the other centered atx =1, then the two pictures
would be indistinguishable.
As described in the opening to this section, having given the deﬁnition of
isomorphism, we next look to support the thesis that it captures our intuition of
vector spaces being the same. First, the deﬁnition itself is persuasive: a vector
space consists of a set and some structure and the deﬁnition simply requires that
the sets correspond and that the structures correspond also. Also persuasive
are the examples above, such as Example 1.1, which dramatize that isomorphic
spaces are the same in all relevant respects. Sometimes people say, whereV ∼=W,
that “W is justV painted green” —diﬀerences are merely cosmetic.
The results below further support our contention that under an isomorphism
all the things of interest in the two vector spaces correspond. Because we
introduced vector spaces to study linear combinations, “of interest” means
“pertaining to linear combinations.” Not of interest is the way that the vectors
are presented typographically (or their color!).
1.10 Lemma An isomorphism maps a zero vector to a zero vector.
Proof Where f :V→W is an isomorphism, ﬁx some⃗v∈ V. Then f(⃗0V ) =
f(0· ⃗v) =0·f(⃗v) = ⃗0W. QED
1.11 Lemma For any mapf :V→W between vector spaces these statements are
equivalent.
(1) f preserves structure
f(⃗v1 + ⃗v2) =f(⃗v1) +f(⃗v2) and f(c⃗v) =cf (⃗v)
(2) f preserves linear combinations of two vectors
f(c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2) =c1f(⃗v1) +c2f(⃗v2)
(3) f preserves linear combinations of any ﬁnite number of vectors
f(c1⃗v1 +··· +cn⃗vn) =c1f(⃗v1) +··· +cnf(⃗vn)
Proof Since the implications(3) =⇒ (2) and (2) =⇒ (1) are clear, we need
only show that(1) =⇒ (3). So assume statement (1). We will prove (3) by
induction on the number of summandsn.
The one-summand base case, thatf(c⃗v1) =cf (⃗v1), is covered by the second
clause of statement (1).
For the inductive step assume that statement (3) holds whenever there arek
or fewer summands. Consider thek +1-summand case. Use the ﬁrst half of (1)
180 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
to break the sum along the ﬁnal ‘+’.
f(c1⃗v1 +··· +ck⃗vk +ck+1⃗vk+1) =f(c1⃗v1 +··· +ck⃗vk) +f(ck+1⃗vk+1)
Use the inductive hypothesis to break up thek-term sum on the left.
=f(c1⃗v1) +··· +f(ck⃗vk) +f(ck+1⃗vk+1)
Now the second half of (1) gives
=c1f(⃗v1) +··· +ckf(⃗vk) +ck+1f(⃗vk+1)
when appliedk +1 times. QED
We often use item (2) to simplify the veriﬁcation that a map preserves structure.
Finally, a summary. In the prior chapter, after giving the deﬁnition of a
vector space, we looked at examples and noted that some spaces seemed to be
essentially the same as others. Here we have deﬁned the relation ‘∼=’ and have
argued that it is the right way to precisely say what we mean by “the same”
because it preserves the features of interest in a vector space—in particular, it
preserves linear combinations. In the next section we will show that isomorphism
is an equivalence relation and so partitions the collection of vector spaces.

is an isomorphism. Thus if the internal direct sum is deﬁned then the internal
and external direct sums are isomorphic.
I.2 Dimension Characterizes Isomorphism
In the prior subsection, after stating the deﬁnition of isomorphism, we gave some
results supporting our sense that such a map describes spaces as “the same.”
Here we will develop this intuition. When two (unequal) spaces are isomorphic
we think of them as almost equal, as equivalent. We shall make that precise by
proving that the relationship ‘is isomorphic to’ is an equivalence relation.
2.1 Lemma The inverse of an isomorphism is also an isomorphism.
Proof Suppose thatV is isomorphic toW viaf :V→W. An isomorphism is a
correspondence between the sets sof has an inverse functionf−1 :W→V that
is also a correspondence.∗
We will show that becausef preserves linear combinations, so also doesf−1.
Suppose that ⃗w1, ⃗w2∈W. Because it is an isomorphism,f is onto and there

184 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
are ⃗v1,⃗v2∈V such that ⃗w1 =f(⃗v1) and ⃗w2 =f(⃗v2). Then
f−1(c1· ⃗w1 +c2· ⃗w2) =f−1(
c1·f(⃗v1) +c2·f(⃗v2)
)
=f−1(f
(
c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2)
)
=c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2 =c1·f−1(⃗w1) +c2·f−1(⃗w2)
since f−1(⃗w1) = ⃗v1 and f−1(⃗w2) = ⃗v2. With that, by Lemma 1.11’s second
statement, this map preserves structure. QED
2.2 Theorem Isomorphism is an equivalence relation between vector spaces.
Proof We must prove that the relation is symmetric, reﬂexive, and transitive.
To check reﬂexivity, that any space is isomorphic to itself, consider the
identity map. It is clearly one-to-one and onto. This shows that it preserves
linear combinations.
id(c1· ⃗v1 +c2· ⃗v2) =c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2 =c1·id(⃗v1) +c2·id(⃗v2)
Symmetry, that ifV is isomorphic toW then alsoW is isomorphic toV,
holds by Lemma 2.1 since each isomorphism map fromV toW is paired with
an isomorphism fromW toV.
To ﬁnish we must check transitivity, that ifV is isomorphic toW andW
is isomorphic toU thenV is isomorphic toU. Let f :V→W andg :W→U
be isomorphisms. Consider their compositiong◦f :V→U. Because the com-
position of correspondences is a correspondence, we need only check that the
composition preserves linear combinations.
g◦f
(
c1· ⃗v1 +c2· ⃗v2
)
=g
(
f(c1· ⃗v1 +c2· ⃗v2 )
)
=g
(
c1·f(⃗v1) +c2·f(⃗v2)
)
=c1·g
(
f(⃗v1)) +c2·g(f(⃗v2)
)
=c1· (g◦f) (⃗v1) +c2· (g◦f) (⃗v2)
Thus the composition is an isomorphism. QED
Since it is an equivalence, isomorphism partitions the universe of vector
spaces into classes: each space is in one and only one isomorphism class.
All ﬁnite dimensional
vector spaces:
...
V
W V ∼=W
The next result characterizes these classes by dimension. That is, we can describe
each class simply by giving the number that is the dimension of all of the spaces
in that class.
Section I. Isomorphisms 185
2.3 Theorem Vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same
dimension.
In this double implication statement the proof of each half involves a signiﬁ-
cant idea so we will do the two separately.
2.4 Lemma If spaces are isomorphic then they have the same dimension.
Proof We shall show that an isomorphism of two spaces gives a correspon-
dence between their bases. That is, we shall show that iff :V→W is an
isomorphism and a basis for the domainV isB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ then its image
D =⟨f(⃗β1),...,f (⃗βn)⟩ is a basis for the codomainW. (The other half of the
correspondence, that for any basis ofW the inverse image is a basis forV, follows
from the fact thatf−1 is also an isomorphism and so we can apply the prior
sentence tof−1.)
To see thatD spansW, ﬁx any⃗w∈W. Becausef is an isomorphism it is
onto and so there is a⃗v∈V with ⃗w =f(⃗v). Expand ⃗v as a combination of basis
vectors.
⃗w =f(⃗v) =f(v1⃗β1 +··· +vn⃗βn) =v1·f(⃗β1) +··· +vn·f(⃗βn)
For linear independence ofD, if
⃗0W =c1f(⃗β1) +··· +cnf(⃗βn) =f(c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn)
then, sincef is one-to-one and so the only vector sent to⃗0W is ⃗0V, we have that
⃗0V =c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn, which implies that all of thec’s are zero. QED
2.5 Lemma If spaces have the same dimension then they are isomorphic.
Proof We will prove that any space of dimensionn is isomorphic toRn. Then
we will have that all such spaces are isomorphic to each other by transitivity,
which was shown in Theorem 2.2.
Let V be n-dimensional. Fix a basisB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ for the domainV.
Consider the operation of representing the members ofV with respect toB as a
function fromV to Rn.
⃗v =v1⃗β1 +··· +vn⃗βn
RepB



It is well-deﬁned∗ since every⃗v has one and only one such representation (see
Remark 2.7 following this proof).
∗ More information on well-deﬁned is in the appendix.
186 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
This function is one-to-one because if
RepB(u1⃗β1 +··· +un⃗βn) = RepB(v1⃗β1 +··· +vn⃗βn)
then 

u1

un




and sou1 =v1, ..., un =vn, implying that the original argumentsu1⃗β1 +
··· +un⃗βn andv1⃗β1 +··· +vn⃗βn are equal.
This function is onto; any member ofRn
⃗w =


w1
...
wn


is the image of some⃗v∈V, namely ⃗w = RepB(w1⃗β1 +··· +wn⃗βn).
Finally, this function preserves structure.
RepB(r· ⃗u +s· ⃗v) = RepB( (ru1 +sv1)⃗β1 +··· + (run +svn)⃗βn )
=





vn


=r·RepB(⃗u) +s·RepB(⃗v)
Therefore RepB is an isomorphism. Consequently anyn-dimensional space
is isomorphic toRn. QED
2.6 Remark When we introduced theRepB notation for vectors on page 125, we
noted that it is not standard and said that one advantage it has is that it is
harder to overlook. Here we see its other advantage: this notation makes explicit
that RepB is a function fromV to Rn.
2.7 Remark The proof has a sentence about ‘well-deﬁned.’ Its point is that to be
an isomorphismRepB must be a function. The deﬁnition of function requires
that for all inputs the associated output must exists and must be determined by
the input. So we must check that every⃗v is associated with at least oneRepB(⃗v),
and with no more than one.
Section I. Isomorphisms 187
In the proof we express elements⃗v of the domain space as combinations
of members of the basisB and then associate ⃗v with the column vector of
coeﬃcients. That there is at least one expansion of each⃗v holds becauseB is a
basis and so spans the space.
The worry that there is no more than one associated member of the codomain
is subtler. A contrasting example, where an association fails this unique output
requirement, illuminates the issue. Let the domain beP2 and consider a set that
is not a basis (it is not linearly independent, although it does span the space).
A = {1 +0x +0x2,0 +1x +0x2,0 +0x +1x2,1 +1x +2x2 }
Call those polynomials⃗α1, ..., ⃗α4. In contrast to the situation when the set
is a basis, here there can be more than one expression of a domain vector in
terms of members of the set. For instance, consider⃗v =1 +x +x2. Here are
two diﬀerent expansions.
⃗v =1⃗α1 +1⃗α2 +1⃗α3 +0⃗α4 ⃗v =0⃗α1 +0⃗α2 −1⃗α3 +1⃗α4
So this input vector⃗v is associated with more than one column.

Thus, withA the association is not well-deﬁned. (The issue is thatA is not
linearly independent; to show uniqueness Theorem Two.III.1.12’s proof uses only
linear independence.)
In general, any time that we deﬁne a function we must check that output
values are well-deﬁned. Most of the time that condition is perfectly obvious but
in the above proof it needs veriﬁcation. See Exercise 22.

one of theRn.

this chapter we’ll consider these ideas again, and ﬁll them out. As a taste of
this we will expand here on the proof of Lemma 2.5.

Then extend this association to all of the members of two spaces.

We close with a recap. Recall that the ﬁrst chapter deﬁnes two matrices to be
row equivalent if they can be derived from each other by row operations. There
we showed that relation is an equivalence and so the collection of matrices is
partitioned into classes, where all the matrices that are row equivalent together
fall into a single class. Then for insight into which matrices are in each class we
gave representatives for the classes, the reduced echelon form matrices.
In this section we have followed that pattern except that the notion here
of “the same” is vector space isomorphism. We deﬁned it and established some
properties, including that it is an equivalence. Then, as before, we developed
a list of class representatives to help us understand the partition—it classiﬁes
vector spaces by dimension.
In Chapter Two, with the deﬁnition of vector spaces, we seemed to have
opened up our studies to many examples of new structures besides the familiar
Rn’s. We now know that isn’t the case. Any ﬁnite-dimensional vector space is
actually “the same” as a real space.

Section II. Homomorphisms 191
II Homomorphisms
The deﬁnition of isomorphism has two conditions. In this section we will consider
the second one. We will study maps that are required only to preserve structure,
maps that are not also required to be correspondences.
Experience shows that these maps are tremendously useful. For one thing
we shall see in the second subsection below that while isomorphisms describe
how spaces are the same, we can think of these maps as describing how spaces
are alike.
II.1 Deﬁnition
1.1Deﬁnition Afunctionbetweenvectorspaces h :V→W thatpreservesaddition
if ⃗v1,⃗v2∈V thenh(⃗v1 + ⃗v2) =h(⃗v1) +h(⃗v2)
and scalar multiplication
if ⃗v∈V andr∈ R thenh(r· ⃗v) =r·h(⃗v)
is ahomomorphism or linear map.

This is not an isomorphism since it is not one-to-one. For instance, both⃗0 and
⃗e3 in R3 map to the zero vector inR2.
192 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
1.3 Example The domain and codomain can be other than spaces of column
vectors. Both of these are homomorphisms; the veriﬁcations are straightforward.
(1) f1 : P2→ P3 given by
a0 +a1x +a2x2 ↦→ a0x + (a1/2)x2 + (a2/3)x3
(2) f2 :M2×2→ R given by
(
a b

)
↦→a +d
1.4 Example Between any two spaces there is azero homomorphism, mapping
every vector in the domain to the zero vector in the codomain.
We shall use the two terms ‘homomorphism’ and ‘linear map’ interchangably.
1.5 Example These two suggest why we say ‘linear map’.
(1) The mapg : R3→ R given by


x

g

is linear, that is, is a homomorphism. The check is easy. In contrast, the
map ˆg : R3→ R given by


x
y
z


ˆg
↦−→3x +2y −4.5z +1
is not linear. To show this we need only produce a single linear combination
that the map does not preserve. Here is one.
ˆg(

Finding a linear combination that the second map does not preserve is
easy.
Section II. Homomorphisms 193
So one way to think of ‘homomorphism’ is that we are generalizing ‘isomor-
phism’ (by dropping the condition that the map is a correspondence), motivated
by the observation that many of the properties of isomorphisms have only to
do with the map’s structure-preservation property. The next two results are
examples of this motivation. In the prior section we saw a proof for each that
only uses preservation of addition and preservation of scalar multiplication, and
therefore applies to homomorphisms.
1.6 Lemma A linear map sends the zero vector to the zero vector.
1.7 Lemma The following are equivalent for any mapf :V→W between vector
spaces.
(1) f is a homomorphism
(2) f(c1·⃗v1 +c2·⃗v2) =c1·f(⃗v1) +c2·f(⃗v2) for anyc1,c2∈ R and ⃗v1,⃗v2∈V
(3) f(c1·⃗v1 +··· +cn·⃗vn) =c1·f(⃗v1) +··· +cn·f(⃗vn) for anyc1,...,c n∈ R
and ⃗v1,..., ⃗vn∈V

f

However, some things that hold for isomorphisms fail to hold for homo-
morphisms. One example is in the proof of Lemma I.2.4, which shows that
an isomorphism between spaces gives a correspondence between their bases.
Homomorphisms do not give any such correspondence; Example 1.2 shows this
and another example is the zero map between two nontrivial spaces. Instead,
for homomorphisms we have a weaker but still very useful result.
1.9 Theorem A homomorphism is determined by its action on a basis: ifV is a vec-
tor space with basis⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩, ifW is a vector space, and if⃗w1,..., ⃗wn∈W
(these codomain elements need not be distinct) then there exists a homomor-
phism fromV toW sending each ⃗βi to ⃗wi, and that homomorphism is unique.
194 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
Proof For any input⃗v∈ V let its expression with respect to the basis be
⃗v =c1⃗β1+··· +cn⃗βn. Deﬁnetheassociatedoutputbyusingthesamecoordinates
h(⃗v) = c1 ⃗w1 +··· +cn ⃗wn. This is well deﬁned because, with respect to the
basis, the representation of each domain vector⃗v is unique.
This map is a homomorphism because it preserves linear combinations: where
⃗v1 =c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn and ⃗v2 =d1⃗β1 +··· +dn⃗βn, here is the calculation.
h(r1⃗v1 +r2⃗v2) =h( (r1c1 +r2d1)⃗β1 +··· + (r1cn +r2dn)⃗βn )
= (r1c1 +r2d1)⃗w1 +··· + (r1cn +r2dn)⃗wn
=r1h(⃗v1) +r2h(⃗v2)
This map is unique because ifˆh :V→W is another homomorphism satisfying
that ˆh(⃗βi) = ⃗wi for eachi then h and ˆh have the same eﬀect on all of the
vectors in the domain.
ˆh(⃗v) = ˆh(c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn) =c1ˆh(⃗β1) +··· +cnˆh(⃗βn)
=c1 ⃗w1 +··· +cn ⃗wn =h(⃗v)
They have the same action so they are the same function. QED
1.10 DeﬁnitionLet V and W be vector spaces and letB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ be a
basis forV. A function deﬁned on that basisf :B→W is extended linearly
to a functionˆf :V→W if for all⃗v∈V such that ⃗v =c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn, the
action of the map isˆf(⃗v) =c1·f(⃗β1) +··· +cn·f(⃗βn).
1.11 Example If we specify a maph : R2→ R2 that acts on the standard basis
E2 in this way
h(
(
1
0
)
) =
(
−1
1
)
h(
(
0
1
)
) =
(
−4
4
)
then we have also speciﬁed the action ofh on any other member of the domain.
For instance, the value ofh on this argument
h(
(
3
−2
)
) =h(3·
(
1
0
)
−2·
(
0
1
)
) =3·h(
(
1
0
)
) −2·h(
(
0
1
)
) =
(
5
−5
)
is a direct consequence of the value ofh on the basis vectors.
Later in this chapter we shall develop a convenient scheme for computations
like this one, using matrices.
Section II. Homomorphisms 195
1.12 DeﬁnitionA linear map from a space into itselft :V→V is alinear trans-
formation.
1.13 Remark In this book we use ‘linear transformation’ only in the case where
the codomain equals the domain. Be aware that some sources instead use it as a
synonym for ‘linear map’. Still another synonym is ‘linear operator’.
1.14 Example The map onR2 that projects all vectors down to thex-axis is a
linear transformation. (
x
y
)
↦→
(
x
0
)
1.15 Example The derivative mapd/dx : Pn→ Pn
a0 +a1x +··· +anxn d/dx
↦−→a1 +2a2x +3a3x2 +··· +nanxn−1
is a linear transformation as this result from calculus shows:d(c1f +c2g)/dx =
c1 (df/dx) +c2 (dg/dx).
1.16 Example The matrix transpose operation
(
a b
c d
)
↦→
(
a c
b d
)
is a linear transformation ofM2×2. (Transpose is one-to-one and onto and so is
in fact an automorphism.)
We ﬁnish this subsection about maps by recalling that we can linearly combine
maps. For instance, for these maps fromR2 to itself
(
x
y
)
f
↦−→
(
2x
3x −2y
)
and
(
x

)

the linear combination5f −2g is also a transformation ofR2.

1.17 Lemma For vector spacesV andW, the set of linear functions fromV to
W is itself a vector space, a subspace of the space of all functions fromV toW.
We denote the space of linear maps fromV toW by L(V,W ).
Proof This set is non-empty because it contains the zero homomorphism. So
to show that it is a subspace we need only check that it is closed under the
196 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
operations. Letf,g :V→W be linear. Then the operation of function addition
is preserved
(f +g)(c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2) =f(c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2) +g(c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2)
=c1f(⃗v1) +c2f(⃗v2) +c1g(⃗v1) +c2g(⃗v2)
=c1
(
f +g
)
(⃗v1) +c2
(
f +g
)
(⃗v2)
as is the operation of scalar multiplication of a function.
(r·f)(c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2) =r(c1f(⃗v1) +c2f(⃗v2))
=c1(r·f)(⃗v1) +c2(r·f)(⃗v2)
Hence L(V,W ) is a subspace. QED
We started this section by deﬁning ‘homomorphism’ as a generalization of
‘isomorphism’, by isolating the structure preservation property. Some of the
points about isomorphisms carried over unchanged, while we adapted others.
Note, however, that the idea of ‘homomorphism’ is in no way somehow
secondary to that of ‘isomorphism’. In the rest of this chapter we shall work
mostly with homomorphisms. This is partly because any statement made about
homomorphisms is automatically true about isomorphisms but more because,
while the isomorphism concept is more natural, our experience will show that
the homomorphism concept is more fruitful and more central to progress.

II.2 Range Space and Null Space
Isomorphisms and homomorphisms both preserve structure. The diﬀerence is
that homomorphisms have fewer restrictions, since they needn’t be onto and
needn’t be one-to-one. We will examine what can happen with homomorphisms
that cannot happen with isomorphisms.
First consider the fact that homomorphisms need not be onto. Of course,
each function is onto some set, namely its range. For example, the injection
mapι : R2→ R3
(
x
y
)
↦→


x
y
0


is a homomorphism, and is not ontoR3. But it is onto thexy-plane.
200 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
2.1 Lemma Under a homomorphism, the image of any subspace of the domain is
a subspace of the codomain. In particular, the image of the entire space, the
range of the homomorphism, is a subspace of the codomain.
Proof Leth :V→W be linear and letS be a subspace of the domainV. The
image h(S) is a subset of the codomainW, which is nonempty becauseS is
nonempty. Thus, to show thath(S) is a subspace ofW we need only show that
it is closed under linear combinations of two vectors. Ifh(⃗s1) and h(⃗s2) are
membersof h(S)thenc1·h(⃗s1)+c2·h(⃗s2) =h(c1·⃗s1)+h(c2·⃗s2) =h(c1·⃗s1+c2·⃗s2)
is also a member ofh(S) because it is the image ofc1· ⃗s1 +c2· ⃗s2 fromS. QED
2.2 DeﬁnitionThe range spaceof a homomorphismh :V→W is
R(h) = {h(⃗v) | ⃗v∈V }
sometimes denotedh(V). The dimension of the range space is the map’srank.
We shall soon see the connection between the rank of a map and the rank of a
matrix.
2.3 Example For the derivative mapd/dx : P3→ P3 given bya0 +a1x +a2x2 +
a3x3↦→ a1 +2a2x +3a3x2 the range space R(d/dx) is the set of quadratic
polynomials {r +sx +tx2 |r,s,t ∈ R }. Thus, this map’s rank is3.
2.4 Example With this homomorphismh :M2×2→ P3
(
a b
c d
)
↦→ (a +b +2d) +cx2 +cx3
an image vector in the range can have any constant term, must have anx
coeﬃcient of zero, and must have the same coeﬃcient ofx2 as ofx3. That is,
the range space isR(h) = {r +sx2 +sx3 |r,s∈ R } and so the rank is2.
The prior result shows that, in passing from the deﬁnition of isomorphism to
the more general deﬁnition of homomorphism, omitting the onto requirement
doesn’t make an essential diﬀerence. Any homomorphism is onto some space,
namely its range.
However, omitting the one-to-one condition does make a diﬀerence. A
homomorphism may have many elements of the domain that map to one element
of the codomain. Below is a bean sketch of a many-to-one map between sets.∗ It
shows three elements of the codomain that are each the image of many members
of the domain. (Rather than picture lots of individual↦→ arrows, each association
of many inputs with one output shows only one such arrow.)

Recall that for any functionh :V→W, the set of elements ofV that map to
⃗w∈W is theinverse imageh−1(⃗w) = {⃗v∈V |h(⃗v) = ⃗w }. Above, the left side
shows three inverse image sets.

202 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
In generalizing from isomorphisms to homomorphisms by dropping the one-
to-one condition we lose the property that, intuitively, the domain is “the same”
as the range. We lose, that is, that the domain corresponds perfectly to the range.
The examples below illustrate that what we retain is that a homomorphism
describes how the domain is “analogous to” or “like” the range.
2.7 Example We think of R3 as like R2 except that vectors have an extra
component. That is, we think of the vector with componentsx, y, andz as
like the vector with componentsx andy. Deﬁning the projection mapπ makes
precise which members of the domain we are thinking of as related to which
members of the codomain.
To understanding how the preservation conditions in the deﬁnition of homo-
morphism show that the domain elements are like the codomain elements, start
by picturing R2 as thexy-plane inside ofR3 (thexy plane inside ofR3 is a set
of three-tall vectors with a third component of zero and so does not precisely
equal the set of two-tall vectorsR2, but this embedding makes the picture much
clearer). The preservation of addition property says that vectors inR3 act like
their shadows in the plane.



 above
(x1

plus



)
equals


x1 +y1
y1 +y2
z1 +z2

 above
(x1 +x2
y1 +y2
)
Thinking ofπ(⃗v) as the “shadow” of⃗v in the plane gives this restatement: the
sum of the shadowsπ(⃗v1) +π(⃗v2) equals the shadow of the sumπ(⃗v1 + ⃗v2).
Preservation of scalar multiplication is similar.
Drawing the codomainR2 on the right gives a picture that is uglier but is
more faithful to the bean sketch above.
⃗w1
⃗w2
⃗w1 + ⃗w2
Again, the domain vectors that map to⃗w1 lie in a vertical line; one is drawn, in
gray. Call any member of this inverse imageπ−1(⃗w1) a “⃗w1 vector.” Similarly,
there is a vertical line of “⃗w2 vectors” and a vertical line of “⃗w1 + ⃗w2 vectors.”
Section II. Homomorphisms 203
Now, saying that π is a homomorphism is recognizing that ifπ(⃗v1) = ⃗w1
and π(⃗v2) = ⃗w2 then π(⃗v1 + ⃗v2) = π(⃗v1) +π(⃗v2) = ⃗w1 + ⃗w2. That is, the
classes add: any⃗w1 vector plus any⃗w2 vector equals a⃗w1 + ⃗w2 vector. Scalar
multiplication is similar.
So although R3 and R2 are not isomorphicπ describes a way in which they
are alike: vectors inR3 add as do the associated vectors inR2—vectors add as
their shadows add.
2.8 Example A homomorphism can express an analogy between spaces that is
more subtle than the prior one. For the map from Example 2.6
(
x
y
)
h
↦−→x +y
ﬁx two numbers in the rangew1,w2∈ R. A ⃗v1 that maps tow1 has components
that add tow1, so the inverse imageh−1(w1) is the set of vectors with endpoint
on the diagonal linex +y =w1. Think of these as “w1 vectors.” Similarly we
have “w2 vectors” and “w1 +w2 vectors.” The addition preservation property
says this.
⃗v1 ⃗v2
⃗v1 + ⃗v2
a “w1 vector” plus a “ w2 vector” equals a “ w1 +w2 vector”
Restated, if we add aw1 vector to aw2 vector thenh maps the result to a
w1 +w2 vector. Brieﬂy, the sum of the images is the image of the sum. Even
more brieﬂy,h(⃗v1) +h(⃗v2) =h(⃗v1 + ⃗v2).
2.9 Example The inverse images can be structures other than lines. For the linear
maph : R3→ R2



↦→
(
x

the inverse image sets are planesx =0,x =1, etc., perpendicular to thex-axis.
204 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
We won’t describe how every homomorphism that we will use is an analogy
because the formal sense that we make of “alike in that ...” is ‘a homomorphism
exists such that ...’. Nonetheless, the idea that a homomorphism between two
spaces expresses how the domain’s vectors fall into classes that act like the
range’s vectors is a good way to view homomorphisms.
Another reason that we won’t treat all of the homomorphisms that we see as
above is that many vector spaces are hard to draw, e.g., a space of polynomials.
But there is nothing wrong with leveraging spaces that we can draw: from the
three examples 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 we draw two insights.
The ﬁrst insight is that in all three examples the inverse image of the range’s
zero vector is a line or plane through the origin. It is therefore a subspace of the
domain.
2.10 Lemma For any homomorphism the inverse image of a subspace of the
range is a subspace of the domain. In particular, the inverse image of the trivial
subspace of the range is a subspace of the domain.
(The examples above consider inverse images of single vectors but this result
is about inverse images of setsh−1(S) = {⃗v∈V |h(⃗v)∈S }. We use the same
term for both by taking the inverse image of a single elementh−1(⃗w) to be the
inverse image of the one-element seth−1({ ⃗w }).)
Proof Leth :V→W be a homomorphism and letS be a subspace of the range
space ofh. Consider the inverse image ofS. It is nonempty because it contains
⃗0V, sinceh(⃗0V ) = ⃗0W and ⃗0W is an element ofS asS is a subspace. To ﬁnish we
show thath−1(S) is closed under linear combinations. Let⃗v1 and ⃗v2 be two of
its elements, so thath(⃗v1) andh(⃗v2) are elements ofS. Thenc1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2 is an
element of the inverse imageh−1(S) becauseh(c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2) =c1h(⃗v1) +c2h(⃗v2)
is a member ofS. QED
2.11 DeﬁnitionThe null spaceor kernel of a linear maph :V→W is the inverse
image of⃗0W.
N (h) =h−1(⃗0W) = {⃗v∈V |h(⃗v) = ⃗0W }
The dimension of the null space is the map’snullity.
0V 0W
Section II. Homomorphisms 205
2.12 Example The map from Example 2.3 has this null space N (d/dx) =
{a0 +0x +0x2 +0x3 |a0∈ R } so its nullity is1.
2.13 Example The map from Example 2.4 has this null space, and nullity2.
N (h) = {
(
a b
0 −(a +b)/2
)
|a,b∈ R }
Now for the second insight from the above examples. In Example 2.7 each of
the vertical lines squashes down to a single point—in passing from the domain to
the range,π takes all of these one-dimensional vertical lines and maps them to a
point, leaving the range smaller than the domain by one dimension. Similarly, in
Example 2.8 the two-dimensional domain compresses to a one-dimensional range
by breaking the domain into the diagonal lines and maps each of those to a single
member of the range. Finally, in Example 2.9 the domain breaks into planes
which get squashed to a point and so the map starts with a three-dimensional
domain but ends two smaller, with a one-dimensional range. (The codomain
is two-dimensional but the range is one-dimensional and the dimension of the
range is what matters.)
2.14 Theorem A linear map’s rank plus its nullity equals the dimension of its
domain.
Proof Let h :V→W be linear and let BN = ⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βk⟩ be a basis for
the null space. Expand that to a basisBV =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βk, ⃗βk+1,..., ⃗βn⟩ for
the entire domain, using Corollary Two.III.2.12. We shall show thatBR =
⟨h(⃗βk+1),...,h (⃗βn)⟩ is a basis for the range space. Then counting the size of
the bases gives the result.
To see thatBR is linearly independent, consider⃗0W =ck+1h(⃗βk+1) +··· +
cnh(⃗βn). We have⃗0W =h(ck+1⃗βk+1+··· +cn⃗βn)and sock+1⃗βk+1+··· +cn⃗βn
is in the null space ofh. AsBN is a basis for the null space there are scalars
c1,...,c k satisfying this relationship.
c1⃗β1 +··· +ck⃗βk =ck+1⃗βk+1 +··· +cn⃗βn
But this is an equation among members ofBV, which is a basis forV, so each
ci equals0. ThereforeBR is linearly independent.
To show thatBR spans the range space consider a member of the range space
h(⃗v). Express ⃗v as a linear combination⃗v = c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn of members
ofBV. This givesh(⃗v) = h(c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn) = c1h(⃗β1) +··· +ckh(⃗βk) +
ck+1h(⃗βk+1) +··· +cnh(⃗βn) and since ⃗β1, ..., ⃗βk are in the null space, we
have thath(⃗v) = ⃗0 +··· + ⃗0 +ck+1h(⃗βk+1) +··· +cnh(⃗βn). Thus,h(⃗v) is a
linear combination of members ofBR, and soBR spans the range space. QED



the range space and null space are

 |a,b∈ R } and N (h) = {


and so the rank ofh is2 while the nullity is1.
2.16 Example Ift : R→ R is the linear transformationx↦→ −4x, then the range
is R(t) = R. The rank is1 and the nullity is0.
2.17 Corollary The rank of a linear map is less than or equal to the dimension of
the domain. Equality holds if and only if the nullity of the map is0.
We know that an isomorphism exists between two spaces if and only if the
dimension of the range equals the dimension of the domain. We have now seen
that for a homomorphism to exist a necessary condition is that the dimension of
the range must be less than or equal to the dimension of the domain. For instance,
there is no homomorphism fromR2 onto R3. There are many homomorphisms
from R2 into R3, but none onto.
The range space of a linear map can be of dimension strictly less than the
dimension of the domain and so linearly independent sets in the domain may
map to linearly dependent sets in the range. (Example 2.3’s derivative transfor-
mation on P3 has a domain of dimension4 but a range of dimension3 and the
derivative sends{1,x,x 2,x3 } to {0,1,2x,3x 2 }). That is, under a homomorphism
independence may be lost. In contrast, dependence stays.
2.18 Lemma Under a linear map, the image of a linearly dependent set is linearly
dependent.
Proof Suppose thatc1⃗v1 +··· +cn⃗vn = ⃗0V with someci nonzero. Applyh to
both sides: h(c1⃗v1 +··· +cn⃗vn) = c1h(⃗v1) +··· +cnh(⃗vn) andh(⃗0V ) = ⃗0W.
Thus we havec1h(⃗v1) +··· +cnh(⃗vn) = ⃗0W with someci nonzero. QED
When is independence not lost? The obvious suﬃcient condition is when
the homomorphism is an isomorphism. This condition is also necessary; see
Section II. Homomorphisms 207
Exercise 37. We will ﬁnish this subsection comparing homomorphisms with
isomorphisms by observing that a one-to-one homomorphism is an isomorphism
from its domain onto its range.

(
x
y
)
ι
↦−→



gives a correspondence betweenR2 and thexy-plane subset ofR3.
2.20 Theorem WhereV is ann-dimensional vector space, these are equivalent
statements about a linear maph :V→W.
(1) h is one-to-one
(2) h has an inverse from its range to its domain that is a linear map
(3) N (h) = {⃗0 }, that is, nullity(h) =0
(4) rank(h) =n
(5) if⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ is a basis forV then⟨h(⃗β1),...,h (⃗βn)⟩ is a basis forR(h)
Proof We will ﬁrst show that(1)⇐⇒(2). We will then show that(1) =⇒
(3) =⇒ (4) =⇒ (5) =⇒ (2).
For(1) =⇒ (2), suppose that the linear maph is one-to-one, and therefore
has an inverseh−1 : R(h)→V. The domain of that inverse is the range ofh and
thus a linear combination of two members of it has the formc1h(⃗v1) +c2h(⃗v2).
On that combination, the inverseh−1 gives this.
h−1(c1h(⃗v1) +c2h(⃗v2)) =h−1(h(c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2))
=h−1◦h (c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2)
=c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2
=c1·h−1(h(⃗v1)) +c2·h−1(h(⃗v2))
Thus if a linear map has an inverse then the inverse must be linear. But this also
gives the (2)=⇒ (1) implication, because the inverse itself must be one-to-one.
Oftheremainingimplications, (1) =⇒ (3)holdsbecauseanyhomomorphism
maps ⃗0V to ⃗0W, but a one-to-one map sends at most one member ofV to ⃗0W.
Next, (3) =⇒ (4) is true since rank plus nullity equals the dimension of the
domain.
For (4) =⇒ (5), to show that⟨h(⃗β1),...,h (⃗βn)⟩ is a basis for the range
space we need only show that it is a spanning set, because by assumption
the range has dimensionn. Consider h(⃗v)∈ R(h). Expressing ⃗v as a linear
208 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
combination of basis elements producesh(⃗v) = h(c1⃗β1 +c2⃗β2 +··· +cn⃗βn),
which gives thath(⃗v) =c1h(⃗β1) +··· +cnh(⃗βn), as desired.
Finally, for the(5) =⇒ (2) implication, assume that⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ is a basis
forV so that⟨h(⃗β1),...,h (⃗βn)⟩ is a basis forR(h). Then every ⃗w∈ R(h) has
the unique representation ⃗w =c1h(⃗β1) +··· +cnh(⃗βn). Deﬁne a map from
R(h) toV by
⃗w ↦→ c1⃗β1 +c2⃗β2 +··· +cn⃗βn
(uniqueness of the representation makes this well-deﬁned). Checking that it is
linear and that it is the inverse ofh are easy. QED
We have seen that a linear map expresses how the structure of the domain is
like that of the range. We can think of such a map as organizing the domain
space into inverse images of points in the range. In the special case that the map
is one-to-one, each inverse image is a single point and the map is an isomorphism
between the domain and the range.

III Computing Linear Maps
The prior section shows that a linear map is determined by its action on a basis.
The equation
h(⃗v) =h(c1· ⃗β1 +··· +cn· ⃗βn) =c1·h(⃗β1) +··· +cn·h(⃗βn)
describes how we get the value of the map on any vector⃗v by starting from the
value of the map on the vectors⃗βi in a basis and extending linearly.
This section gives a convenient scheme based on matrices to use the represen-
tations ofh(⃗β1), ..., h(⃗βn) to compute, from the representation of a vector in
the domainRepB(⃗v), the representation of that vector’s image in the codomain
RepD(h(⃗v)).

In the middle is the argument⃗v to the map, represented with respect to the
domain’s basisB by the column vector with componentsc1 and c2. On the
right is the value of the map on that argumenth(⃗v), represented with respect to
the codomain’s basisD. The matrix on the left is the new thing. We will use it
to represent the map and we will think of the above equation as representing an
application of the map to the matrix.
That matrix consists of the coeﬃcients from the vector on the right,0 and
1 from the ﬁrst row,−1/2 and −1 from the second row, and1 and0 from the
third row. That is, we make it by adjoining the vectors representing theh(⃗βi)’s.

is thematrix representation ofh with respect toB,D.
In that matrix the number of columnsn is the dimension of the map’s domain
while the number of rowsm is the dimension of the codomain.
1.3 Remark As with the notation for represenation of a vector, theRepB,D
notation here is not standard. The most common alternative is[h]B,D.
We use lower case letters for a map, upper case for the matrix, and lower case
again for the entries of the matrix. Thus for the maph, the matrix representing
it isH, with entrieshi,j.

Brieﬂy, application of a linear map is represented by the matrix-vector
product of the map’s representative and the vector’s representative.
1.7 Remark Theorem 1.5 is not surprising, because we chose the matrix repre-
sentative in Deﬁnition 1.2 precisely to make the theorem true—if the theorem
216 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
were not true then we would adjust the deﬁnition to make it so. Nonetheless,
we need the veriﬁcation.
1.8 Example For the matrix from Example 1.4 we can calculate where that map
sends this vector.
⃗v =



With respect to the domain basisB the representation of this vector is
RepB(⃗v) =



B
and so the matrix-vector product gives the representation of the valueh(⃗v) with
respect to the codomain basisD.
RepD(h(⃗v)) =
(

−1/2 −1 −2

To ﬁndh(⃗v) itself, not its representation, take(9/2)(1 +x) − (9/2)(−1 +x) =9.

We now have two ways to compute the eﬀect of projection, the straightforward
formula that drops each three-tall vector’s third component to make a two-tall
vector, and the above formula that uses representations and matrix-vector
multiplication. The second way may seem complicated compared to the ﬁrst,
but it has advantages. The next example shows that for some maps this new
scheme simpliﬁes the formula.
1.10 Example To represent a rotation maptθ : R2→ R2 that turns all vectors in
the plane counterclockwise through an angleθ
⃗u
tπ/6(⃗u)tπ/6
−→
218 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
we start by ﬁxing the standard basesE2 for both the domain and codomain
basis, Now ﬁnd the image under the map of each vector in the domain’s basis.

(

) (

tθ

(∗)
Represent these images with respect to the codomain’s basis. Because this basis
is E2, vectors represent themselves. Adjoin the representations to get the matrix
representing the map.
RepE2,E2 (tθ) =
(
cosθ −sinθ
sinθ cosθ
)
The advantage of this scheme is that we get a formula for the image of any
vector at all just by knowing in (∗) how to represent the image of the two basis
vectors. For instance, here we rotate a vector byθ =π/6.

1.11 Example In the deﬁnition of matrix-vector product the width of the matrix
equals the height of the vector. Hence, this product is not deﬁned.
(
1 0 0
4 3 1
)(
1
0
)
It is undeﬁned for a reason: the three-wide matrix represents a map with a
three-dimensional domain while the two-tall vector represents a member of a
two-dimensional space. So the vector cannot be in the domain of the map.
Nothing in Deﬁnition 1.6 forces us to view matrix-vector product in terms
of representations. We can get some insights by focusing on how the entries
combine.
A good way to view matrix-vector product is that it is formed from the dot
products of the rows of the matrix with the column vector.

Looked at in this row-by-row way, this new operation generalizes dot product.
We can also view the operation column-by-column.



This way of looking at matrix-vector product brings us back to the objective
stated at the start of this section, to computeh(c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn) asc1h(⃗β1) +
··· +cnh(⃗βn).
We began this section by noting that the equality of these two enables us
to compute the action ofh on any argument knowing onlyh(⃗β1), ..., h(⃗βn).
We have developed this into a scheme to compute the action of the map by
taking the matrix-vector product of the matrix representing the map with the
vector representing the argument. In this way, with respect to any bases, for any
linear map there is a matrix representation. The next subsection will show the
converse, that if we ﬁx bases then for any matrix there is an associated linear
map.

III.2 Any Matrix Represents a Linear Map
The prior subsection shows that the action of a linear maph is described by a
matrixH, with respect to appropriate bases, in this way.
⃗v =


v1
...
vn


B
h
↦−→
H
h(⃗v) =


h1,1v1 +··· +h1,nvn
...
hm,1v1 +··· +hm,nvn


D
(∗)
Here we will show the converse, that each matrix represents a linear map.
So we start with a matrix
H =


h1,1 h1,2 ... h 1,n
h2,1 h2,2 ... h 2,n
...
hm,1 hm,2 ... h m,n


and we will describe how it deﬁnes a maph. We require that the map be
represented by the matrix so ﬁrst note that in (∗) the dimension of the map’s
domain is the number of columnsn of the matrix and the dimension of the
codomain is the number of rowsm. Thus, forh’s domain ﬁx ann-dimensional
vector spaceV and for the codomain ﬁx anm-dimensional spaceW. Also ﬁx
basesB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ andD =⟨⃗δ1,..., ⃗δm⟩ for those spaces.
Now leth :V→W be: where ⃗v in the domain has the representation
RepB(⃗v) =


v1
...
vn


B
then its imageh(⃗v) is the member of the codomain with this representation.
RepD(h(⃗v) ) =


h1,1v1 +··· +h1,nvn
...
hm,1v1 +··· +hm,nvn


D
That is, to compute the action ofh on any⃗v∈V, ﬁrst express⃗v with respect to
the basis⃗v =v1⃗β1 +··· +vn⃗βn and thenh(⃗v) = (h1,1v1 +··· +h1,nvn)· ⃗δ1 +
··· + (hm,1v1 +··· +hm,nvn)· ⃗δm.
Above we have made some choices; for instanceV can be anyn-dimensional
space andB could be any basis forV, soH does not deﬁne a unique function.
However, note once we have ﬁxedV,B,W, andD thenh is well-deﬁned since⃗v
has a unique representation with respect to the basisB and the calculation of⃗w
from its representation is also uniquely determined.

2.1 Example Consider this matrix.
H =

It is3×2 so any map that it deﬁnes must carry a dimension2 domain to a
dimension3 codomain. We can choose the domain and codomain to beR2 and
P2, with these bases.
B =⟨

Then leth : R2→ P2 be the function deﬁned byH. We will compute the image
underh of this member of the domain.

From its representation, computation ofh(⃗v)is routine(−11/2)(x2)−(23/2)(x2+
x) − (35/2)(x2 +x +1) = (−69/2)x2 − (58/2)x − (35/2).
2.2 Theorem Any matrix represents a homomorphism between vector spaces of
appropriate dimensions, with respect to any pair of bases.
Proof We must check that for any matrixH and any domain and codomain
basesB,D, the deﬁned maph is linear. If⃗v, ⃗u∈V are such that
RepB(⃗v) =


v1


 RepB(⃗u) =


andc,d∈ R then the calculation

supplies that check. QED

These are diﬀerent functions. The ﬁrst is projection onto thex-axis while the
second is projection onto they-axis.
This result means that when convenient we can work solely with matrices,
just doing the computations without having to worry whether a matrix of interest
represents a linear map on some pair of spaces.
When we are working with a matrix but we do not have particular spaces or
bases in mind then we can take the domain and codomain to beRn and Rm,
with the standard bases. This is convenient because with the standard bases
vector representation is transparent—the representation of⃗v is ⃗v. (In this case
the column space of the matrix equals the range of the map and consequently
the column space ofH is often denoted byR(H).)
Given a matrix, to come up with an associated map we can choose among
many domain and codomain spaces, and many bases for those. So a matrix can
represent many maps. We ﬁnish this section by illustrating how the matrix can
give us information about the associated maps.
2.4 Theorem The rank of a matrix equals the rank of any map that it represents.
Proof Suppose that the matrixH ism×n. Fix domain and codomain spaces
V andW of dimensionn andm with basesB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ andD. ThenH
represents some linear maph between those spaces with respect to these bases
whose range space
{h(⃗v) | ⃗v∈V } = {h(c1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn) |c1,...,c n∈ R }
= {c1h(⃗β1) +··· +cnh(⃗βn) |c1,...,c n∈ R }
226 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
is the span[{h(⃗β1),...,h (⃗βn) }]. The rank of the maph is the dimension of this
range space.
The rank of the matrix is the dimension of its column space, the span of the
set of its columns[ {RepD(h(⃗β1)),..., RepD(h(⃗βn)) } ].
To see that the two spans have the same dimension, recall from the proof
of Lemma I.2.5 that if we ﬁx a basis then representation with respect to that
basis gives an isomorphismRepD :W→ Rm. Under this isomorphism there is a
linear relationship among members of the range space if and only if the same
relationship holds in the column space, e.g,⃗0 =c1·h(⃗β1) +··· +cn·h(⃗βn) if
and only if⃗0 =c1·RepD(h(⃗β1)) +··· +cn·RepD(h(⃗βn)). Hence, a subset of
the range space is linearly independent if and only if the corresponding subset
of the column space is linearly independent. Therefore the size of the largest
linearly independent subset of the range space equals the size of the largest
linearly independent subset of the column space, and so the two spaces have the
same dimension. QED
That settles the apparent ambiguity in our use of the same word ‘rank’ to
apply both to matrices and to maps.
2.5 Example Any map represented by


1 2 2
1 2 1
0 0 3
0 0 2


must have three-dimensional domain and a four-dimensional codomain. In
addition, because the rank of this matrix is two (we can spot this by eye or get it
with Gauss’s Method), any map represented by this matrix has a two-dimensional
range space.
2.6 Corollary Leth be a linear map represented by a matrixH. Thenh is onto
if and only if the rank ofH equals the number of its rows, andh is one-to-one if
and only if the rank ofH equals the number of its columns.
Proof For the onto half, the dimension of the range space ofh is the rank
ofh, which equals the rank ofH by the theorem. Since the dimension of the
codomain ofh equals the number of rows inH, if the rank ofH equals the
number of rows then the dimension of the range space equals the dimension
of the codomain. But a subspace with the same dimension as its superspace
must equal that superspace (because any basis for the range space is a linearly
independent subset of the codomain whose size is equal to the dimension of the
Section III. Computing Linear Maps 227
codomain, and thus this basis for the range space must also be a basis for the
codomain).
For the other half, a linear map is one-to-one if and only if it is an isomorphism
between its domain and its range, that is, if and only if its domain has the same
dimension as its range. The number of columns inH is the dimension ofh’s
domain and by the theorem the rank ofH equals the dimension ofh’s range.
QED
2.7 DeﬁnitionA linear map that is one-to-one and onto isnonsingular, otherwise
it is singular. That is, a linear map is nonsingular if and only if it is an
isomorphism.
2.8 Remark Some authors use ‘nonsingular’ as a synonym for one-to-one while
others use it the way that we have here. The diﬀerence is slight because any
map is onto its range space, so a one-to-one map is an isomorphism with its
range.
In the ﬁrst chapter we deﬁned a matrix to be nonsingular if it is square and
is the matrix of coeﬃcients of a linear system with a unique solution. The next
result justiﬁes our dual use of the term.
2.9 Lemma A nonsingular linear map is represented by a square matrix. A
square matrix represents nonsingular maps if and only if it is a nonsingular
matrix. Thus, a matrix represents isomorphisms if and only if it is square and
nonsingular.
Proof Assume that the maph :V→W is nonsingular. Corollary 2.6 says that
for any matrixH representing that map, becauseh is onto the number of rows
ofH equals the rank ofH, and becauseh is one-to-one the number of columns
ofH is also equal to the rank ofH. HenceH is square.
Next assume that H is square, n×n. The matrix H is nonsingular if
and only if its row rank isn, which is true if and only ifH’s rank isn by
Theorem Two.III.3.11, which is true if and only ifh’s rank isn by Theorem 2.4,
which is true if and only ifh is an isomorphism by Theorem I.2.3. (This last
holds because the domain ofh isn-dimensional as it is the number of columns
inH.) QED
2.10 Example Any map fromR2 to P1 represented with respect to any pair of
bases by (
1 2
0 3
)
is nonsingular because this matrix has rank two.
228 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
2.11 Example Any mapg :V→W represented by
(
1 2
3 6
)
is singular because this matrix is singular.
We’ve now seen that the relationship between maps and matrices goes both
ways: for a particular pair of bases, any linear map is represented by a matrix
and any matrix describes a linear map. That is, by ﬁxing spaces and bases we
get a correspondence between maps and matrices. In the rest of this chapter
we will explore this correspondence. For instance, we’ve deﬁned for linear maps
the operations of addition and scalar multiplication and we shall see what the
corresponding matrix operations are. We shall also see the matrix operation
that represent the map operation of composition. And, we shall see how to ﬁnd
the matrix that represents a map’s inverse.

one matrix represents two diﬀerent mapsH = RepB,D(h) = Rep ˆB, ˆD(ˆh) (where

and associated pairs of basesB1,D1 and B2,D2 (with B1⁄= B2 or D1⁄= D2 or

IV Matrix Operations
The prior section shows how matrices represent linear maps. We now explore
how this representation interacts with things that we already know. First we
will see how the representation of a scalar productr·f of a linear map relates to
the representation off, and also how the representation of a sumf +g relates to
the representations of the two summands. Later we will do the same comparison
for the map operations of composition and inverse.
IV.1 Sums and Scalar Products
1.1 Example Letf :V→W be a linear function represented with respect to some
bases by this matrix.
RepB,D(f) =
(
1 0
1 1
)
Consider the map that is the scalar multiple5f :V→W. We will relate the
representation RepB,D(5f) with RepB,D(f).
Letf associate ⃗v↦→ ⃗w with these representations.
RepB(⃗v) =
(
v1
v2
)
RepD(⃗w) =
(
w1
w2
)
Where the codomain’s basis isD =⟨⃗δ1,⃗δ2⟩, that representation gives that the
output vector is⃗w =w1⃗δ1 +w2⃗δ2.
The action of the map 5f is ⃗v ↦→ 5⃗w and 5⃗w = 5· (w1⃗δ1 +w2⃗δ2) =
(5w1)⃗δ1 + (5w2)⃗δ2. So5f associates the input vector⃗v with the output vector
having this representation.
RepD(5⃗w) =
(
5w1
5w2
)
Changing from the mapf to the map5f has the eﬀect on the representation of
the output vector of multiplying each entry by5.
Because of that, RepB,D(5f) is this matrix.
RepB,D(5f)·
(
v1
v2
)
=
(
5v1
5v1 +5v2
)
RepB,D(5f) =
(
5 0
5 5
)
Therefore, going from the matrix representingf to the one representing5f means
multiplying all the matrix entries by5.

1.2 Example We can do a similar exploration for the sum of two maps. Suppose
that two linear maps with the same domain and codomainf,g : R2→ R2 are
represented with respect to basesB andD by these matrices.
RepB,D(f) =
(
1 3
2 0
)
RepB,D(g) =
(
−2 −1
2 4
)
Recall the deﬁnition of sum: iff does ⃗v↦→ ⃗u andg does ⃗v↦→ ⃗w thenf +g is
the function whose action is⃗v↦→ ⃗u + ⃗w. Let these be the representations of the
input and output vectors.
RepB(⃗v) =
(
v1
v2
)
RepD(⃗u) =
(
u1
u2
)
RepD(⃗w) =
(
w1
w2
)
Where D = ⟨⃗δ1,⃗δ2⟩ we have ⃗u + ⃗w = (u1⃗δ1 +u2⃗δ2) + (w1⃗δ1 +w2⃗δ2) =
(u1 +w1)⃗δ1 + (u2 +w2)⃗δ2 and so this is the representation of the vector sum.
RepD(⃗u + ⃗w) =
(
u1 +w1
u2 +w2
)
Thus, since these represent the actions of of the mapsf andg on the input⃗v
(
1 3
2 0
)(
v1
v2
)
=
(
v1 +3v2
2v1
) (
−2 −1
2 4
)(
v1
v2
)
=
(
−2v1 −v2
2v1 +4v2
)
adding the entries represents the action of the mapf +g.
RepB,D(f +g)·
(
v1
v2
)
=
(
−v1 +2v2
4v1 +4v2
)
Therefore, we compute the matrix representing the function sum by adding the
entries of the matrices representing the functions.
RepB,D(f +g) =
(
−1 2
4 4
)
1.3 DeﬁnitionThe scalar multiple of a matrix is the result of entry-by-entry
scalar multiplication. Thesum of two same-sized matrices is their entry-by-entry
sum.
These operations extend the ﬁrst chapter’s operations of addition and scalar
multiplication of vectors.
We need a result that proves these matrix operations do what the examples
suggest that they do.

1.4 Theorem Leth,g :V→W be linear maps represented with respect to bases
B,D by the matricesH and G and letr be a scalar. Then with respect to
B,D the mapr·h :V→W is represented byrH and the maph +g :V→W is
represented byH +G.
Proof Generalize the examples. This is Exercise 10. QED
1.5 Remark These two operations on matrices are simple, but we did not deﬁne
them in this way because they are simple. We deﬁned them this way because
they represent function addition and function scalar multiplication. That is,
our program is to deﬁne matrix operations by referencing function operations.
Simplicity is a bonus.
We will see this again in the next subsection, where we will deﬁne the
operation of multiplying matrices. Since we’ve just deﬁned matrix scalar multi-
plication and matrix sum to be entry-by-entry operations, a naive thought is
to deﬁne matrix multiplication to be the entry-by-entry product. In theory we
could do whatever we please but we will instead be practical and combine the
entries in the way that represents the function operation of composition.
A special case of scalar multiplication is multiplication by zero. For any map
0·h is the zero homomorphism and for any matrix0·H is the matrix with all
entries zero.
1.6 DeﬁnitionA zero matrix has all entries0. We write Zn×m or simplyZ
(another common notation is0n×m or just0).
1.7 Example The zero map from any three-dimensional space to any two-
dimensional space is represented by the2×3 zero matrix
Z =
(
0 0 0
0 0 0
)
no matter what domain and codomain bases we use.

IV.2 Matrix Multiplication
After representing addition and scalar multiplication of linear maps in the prior
subsection, the natural next operation to consider is function composition.
2.1 Lemma The composition of linear maps is linear.
Proof (Note: this argument has already appeared, as part of the proof of
Theorem I.2.2.) Leth :V→W andg :W→U be linear. The calculation
g◦h
(
c1· ⃗v1 +c2· ⃗v2
)
=g
(
h(c1· ⃗v1 +c2· ⃗v2)
)
=g
(
c1·h(⃗v1) +c2·h(⃗v2)
)
=c1·g
(
h(⃗v1)) +c2·g(h(⃗v2)
)
=c1· (g◦h)(⃗v1) +c2· (g◦h)(⃗v2)
shows thatg◦h :V→U preserves linear combinations, and so is linear.QED
As we did with the operation of matrix addition and scalar multiplication,
we will see how the representation of the composite relates to the representations
of the compositors by ﬁrst considering an example.
2.2 Example Let h : R4→ R2 and g : R2→ R3, ﬁx basesB ⊂ R4, C ⊂ R2,
D⊂ R3, and let these be the representations.

2.7 Theorem A composition of linear maps is represented by the matrix product
of the representatives.
Proof This argument generalizes Example 2.2. Leth :V→W andg :W→X
be represented byH andG with respect to basesB⊂V,C⊂W, andD⊂X, of
sizesn,r, andm. For any⃗v∈V thek-th component of RepC(h(⃗v) ) is
hk,1v1 +··· +hk,nvn
and so thei-th component of RepD(g◦h (⃗v) ) is this.
gi,1· (h1,1v1 +··· +h1,nvn) +gi,2· (h2,1v1 +··· +h2,nvn)
+··· +gi,r· (hr,1v1 +··· +hr,nvn)
Distribute and regroup on thev’s.
= (gi,1h1,1 +gi,2h2,1 +··· +gi,rhr,1)·v1
+··· + (gi,1h1,n +gi,2h2,n +··· +gi,rhr,n)·vn
Finish by recognizing that the coeﬃcient of eachvj
gi,1h1,j +gi,2h2,j +··· +gi,rhr,j
matches the deﬁnition of thei,j entry of the productGH. QED

Above the arrows, the maps show that the two ways of going fromV to X,
straight over via the composition or else in two steps by way ofW, have the
same eﬀect
⃗v
g◦h
↦−→g(h(⃗v)) ⃗v
h
↦−→h(⃗v)
g
↦−→g(h(⃗v))
(this is just the deﬁnition of composition). Below the arrows, the matrices
indicate that multiplyingGH into the column vectorRepB(⃗v) has the same
eﬀect as multiplying the column vector ﬁrst byH and then multiplying the
result byG.
RepB,D(g◦h) =GH RepC,D(g) RepB,C(h) =GH
As mentioned in Example 2.5, because the number of columns on the left
does not equal the number of rows on the right, the product as here of a2×3
matrix with a2×2 matrix is not deﬁned.
(
−1 2 0
0 10 1.1
)(
0 0
0 2
)
The deﬁnition requires that the sizes match because we want that the underlying
function composition is possible.
dimensionn space
h
−→ dimensionr space
g
−→ dimensionm space ( ∗)
Thus, matrix product combines them×r matrixG with ther×n matrixF to
yield them×n resultGF. Brieﬂy:m×r timesr×n equalsm×n.
2.8 Remark The order of the dimensions can be confusing. In ‘m×r timesr×
n equalsm×n’ the number written ﬁrst ism. Butm appears last in the map
dimension description line (∗) above, and the other dimensions also appear in
reverse. The explanation is that whileh is done ﬁrst, followed byg, we write
the composition asg◦h, withg on the left (arising from the notationg(h(⃗v))).
That carries over to matrices, so thatg◦h is represented byGH.
We can get insight into matrix-matrix product operation by studying how
the entries combine. For instance, an alternative way to understand why we
require above that the sizes match is that the row of the left-hand matrix must
have the same number of entries as the column of the right-hand matrix, or else
some entry will be left without a matching entry from the other matrix.
Another aspect of the combinatorics of matrix multiplication, in the sum
deﬁning thei,j entry, is brought out here by the boxing the equal subscripts.
pi,j =gi,1h1,j +gi,2h2,j +··· +gi,rhr,j
The highlighted subscripts on theg’s are column indices while those on theh’s
are for rows. That is, the summation takes place over the columns ofG but
240 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
over the rows ofH—the deﬁnition treats left diﬀerently than right. So we may
reasonably suspect thatGH can be unequal toHG.

isn’t even deﬁned.
2.11 Remark The fact that matrix multiplication is not commutative can seem
odd at ﬁrst, perhaps because most mathematical operations in prior courses are
commutative. But matrix multiplication represents function composition and
function composition is not commutative: iff(x) = 2x andg(x) = x +1 then
g◦f(x) =2x +1 whilef◦g(x) =2(x +1) =2x +2.
Except for the lack of commutativity, matrix multiplication is algebraically
well-behaved. The next result gives some nice properties and more are in
Exercise 25 and Exercise 26.
2.12 Theorem IfF,G, andH are matrices, and the matrix products are deﬁned,
then the product is associative(FG)H = F(GH) and distributes over matrix
additionF(G +H) =FG +FH and (G +H)F =GF +HF.
Proof Associativity holds because matrix multiplication represents function
composition, which is associative: the maps(f◦g)◦h andf◦ (g◦h) are equal
as both send⃗v tof(g(h(⃗v))).
Distributivity is similar. For instance, the ﬁrst one goesf◦ (g +h) (⃗v) =
f
(
(g +h)(⃗v)
)
=f
(
g(⃗v) +h(⃗v)
)
=f(g(⃗v)) +f(h(⃗v)) = f◦g(⃗v) +f◦h(⃗v) (the
third equality uses the linearity off). Right-distributivity goes the same way.
QED
2.13 Remark We could instead prove that result by slogging through indices. For

example, for associativity thei,j entry of (FG)H is
(fi,1g1,1 +fi,2g2,1 +··· +fi,rgr,1)h1,j
+ (fi,1g1,2 +fi,2g2,2 +··· +fi,rgr,2)h2,j
...
+ (fi,1g1,s +fi,2g2,s +··· +fi,rgr,s)hs,j
whereF,G, andH arem×r,r×s, ands×n matrices. Distribute
fi,1g1,1h1,j +fi,2g2,1h1,j +··· +fi,rgr,1h1,j
+fi,1g1,2h2,j +fi,2g2,2h2,j +··· +fi,rgr,2h2,j
...
+fi,1g1,shs,j +fi,2g2,shs,j +··· +fi,rgr,shs,j
and regroup around thef’s
fi,1(g1,1h1,j +g1,2h2,j +··· +g1,shs,j)
+fi,2(g2,1h1,j +g2,2h2,j +··· +g2,shs,j)
...
+fi,r(gr,1h1,j +gr,2h2,j +··· +gr,shs,j)
to get thei,j entry ofF(GH).
Contrast the two proofs. The index-heavy argument is hard to understand in
that while the calculations are easy to check, the arithmetic seems unconnected
to any idea. The argument in the proof is shorter and also says why this property
“really” holds. This illustrates the comments made at the start of the chapter on
vector spaces—at least sometimes an argument from higher-level constructs is
clearer.
We have now seen how to represent the composition of linear maps. The
next subsection will continue to explore this operation.

IV.3 Mechanics of Matrix Multiplication
We can consider matrix multiplication as a mechanical process, putting aside for
the moment any implications about the underlying maps.
Section IV. Matrix Operations 245
The striking thing about this operation is the way that rows and columns
combine. Thei,j entry of the matrix product is the dot product of rowi of the
left matrix with columnj of the right one. For instance, here a second row and
a third column combine to make a2,3 entry.


1 1



We can view this as the left matrix acting by multiplying its rows into the
columns of the right matrix. Or, it is the right matrix using its columns to act
on the rows of the left matrix. Below, we will examine actions from the left and
from the right for some simple matrices.
Simplest is the zero matrix.
3.1 Example Multiplying by a zero matrix from the left or from the right results
in a zero matrix.(

−1 1 −1

)
=

)
The next easiest matrices are the ones with a single nonzero entry.
3.2 DeﬁnitionA matrix with all0’s except for a1 in thei,j entry is ani,j unit
matrix (ormatrix unit).
3.3 Example This is the1,2 unit matrix with three rows and two columns,
multiplying from the left.




(
5 6
7 8
)
=


7 8
0 0
0 0


Acting from the left, ani,j unit matrix copies rowj of the multiplicand into
rowi of the result. From the right ani,j unit matrix picks out columni of the
multiplicand and copies it into columnj of the result.



3.4 Example Rescaling unit matrices simply rescales the result. This is the action
from the left of the matrix that is twice the one in the prior example.

246 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
Next in complication are matrices with two nonzero entries.
3.5 Example There are two cases. If a left-multiplier has entries in diﬀerent rows
then their actions don’t interact.

1 0 0
0 0 2




=


1 2 3
14 16 18
0 0 0


But if the left-multiplier’s nonzero entries are in the same row then that row of
the result is a combination.

1 0 2

Right-multiplication acts in the same way, but with columns.
3.6 Example Consider the columns of the product of two2×2 matrices.
(
g1,1 g1,2
g2,1 g2,2
)(
h1,1 h1,2
h2,1 h2,2
)
=
(
g1,1h1,1 +g1,2h2,1 g1,1h1,2 +g1,2h2,2
g2,1h1,1 +g2,2h2,1 g2,1h1,2 +g2,2h2,2
)
Each column is the result of multiplyingG by the corresponding column ofH.
G
(
h1,1
h2,1
)
=
(
g1,1h1,1 +g1,2h2,1
g2,1h1,1 +g2,2h2,1
)
G
(
h1,2
h2,2
)
=
(
g1,1h1,2 +g1,2h2,2
g2,1h1,2 +g2,2h2,2
)
3.7 Lemma In a product of two matricesG andH, the columns ofGH are formed
by takingG times the columns ofH
G·



 =



and the rows ofGH are formed by taking the rows ofG timesH



·H =





(ignoring the extra parentheses).
Proof We will check that in a product of2×2 matrices, the rows of the product
equal the product of the rows ofG with the entire matrixH.
(
g1,1 g1,2
g2,1 g2,2
)(
h1,1 h1,2
h2,1 h2,2
)
=
(
(g1,1 g1,2)H
(g2,1 g2,2)H
)
=

(g2,1h1,1 +g2,2h2,1 g2,1h1,2 +g2,2h2,2)
)
We leave the more general check as an exercise. QED
An application of those observations is that there is a matrix that just copies
out the rows and columns.
3.8 DeﬁnitionThe main diagonal (or principal diagonalor simplydiagonal)
of a square matrix goes from the upper left to the lower right.
3.9 DeﬁnitionAn identity matrix is square and every entry is0 except for1’s
in the main diagonal.

In short, an identity matrix is the identity element of the set ofn×n matrices
with respect to the operation of matrix multiplication.
We can generalize the identity matrix by relaxing the ones to arbitrary reals.
The resulting matrix rescales whole rows or columns.
3.12 DeﬁnitionA diagonal matrix is square and has0’s oﬀ the main diagonal.



3.13 Example From the left, the action of multiplication by a diagonal matrix is
to rescales the rows.

We can also generalize identity matrices by putting a single one in each row
and column in ways other than putting them down the diagonal.
3.14 DeﬁnitionA permutation matrixis square and is all0’s except for a single1
in each row and column.

We ﬁnish this subsection by applying these observations to get matrices that
perform Gauss’s Method and Gauss-Jordan reduction. We have already seen
how to produce a matrix that rescales rows, and a row swapper.
3.16 Example Multiplying by this matrix rescales the second row by three.

To see how to perform a row combination, we observe something about those
two examples. The matrix that rescales the second row by a factor of three
arises in this way from the identity.

3.23 Corollary For any matrixH there are elementary reduction matricesR1, ...,
Rr such thatRr·Rr−1··· R1·H is in reduced echelon form.
Until now we have taken the point of view that our primary objects of study
are vector spaces and the maps between them, and we seemed to have adopted
matrices only for computational convenience. This subsection shows that this
isn’t the entire story.
Understanding matrix operations by understanding the mechanics of how
the entries combine is also useful. In the rest of this book we shall continue to
focus on maps as the primary objects but we will be pragmatic—if the matrix
point of view gives some clearer idea then we will go with it.

3.30 The need to take linear combinations of rows and columns in tables of numbers
arises often in practice. For instance, this is a map of part of Vermont and New
York.
In part because of Lake Champlain,
there are no roads directly connect-
ing some pairs of towns. For in-
stance, there is no way to go from
Winooski to Grand Isle without go-
ing through Colchester. (To sim-
plify the graph many other roads
and towns have been omitted. From
top to bottom of this map is about
forty miles.)

IV.4 Inverses
We ﬁnish this section by considering how to represent the inverse of a linear map.
We ﬁrst recall some things about inverses. Whereπ : R3→ R2 is the projection
map andι : R2→ R3 is the embedding


x
y
z


π
↦−→
(
x
y
) (
x

)
ι






then the compositionπ◦ι is the identity mapπ◦ι = id on R2.
(
x
y
)
ι
↦−→


x
y
0


π
↦−→
(
x
y
)
Section IV. Matrix Operations 255
We say thatι is aright inverse ofπ or, what is the same thing, thatπ is a
left inverse ofι. However, composition in the other orderι◦π doesn’t give the
identity map—here is a vector that is not sent to itself underι◦π.


0



π
↦−→
(
0
0
)
ι
↦−→


0
0
0


In fact,π has no left inverse at all. For, iff were to be a left inverse ofπ then
we would have 

x
y
z


π
↦−→
(
x
y
)
f
↦−→


x
y
z


for all of the inﬁnitely manyz’s. But a functionf cannot send a single argument(x
y
)
to more than one value.
So a function can have a right inverse but no left inverse, or a left inverse
but no right inverse. A function can also fail to have an inverse on either side;
one example is the zero transformation onR2.
Some functions have atwo-sided inverse, another function that is the inverse
both from the left and from the right. For instance, the transformation given by
⃗v↦→2· ⃗v has the two-sided inverse⃗v↦→ (1/2)· ⃗v. The appendix shows that a
function has a two-sided inverse if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto.
The appendix also shows that if a functionf has a two-sided inverse then it is
unique, so we call it ‘the’ inverse and writef−1.
In addition, recall that we have shown in Theorem II.2.20 that if a linear
map has a two-sided inverse then that inverse is also linear.
Thus, our goal in this subsection is, where a linearh has an inverse, to ﬁnd
the relationship between RepB,D(h) and RepD,B(h−1).
4.1 DeﬁnitionA matrixG is aleft inverse matrixof the matrixH ifGH is the
identity matrix. It is aright inverse ifHG is the identity. A matrixH with
a two-sided inverse is aninvertible matrix. That two-sided inverse is denoted
H−1.
Because of the correspondence between linear maps and matrices, statements
about map inverses translate into statements about matrix inverses.
4.2 Lemma If a matrix has both a left inverse and a right inverse then the two
are equal.
256 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
4.3 Theorem A matrix is invertible if and only if it is nonsingular.
Proof (For both results.)Given a matrixH, ﬁx spaces of appropriate dimension
for the domain and codomain and ﬁx bases for these spaces. With respect to
these bases,H represents a maph. The statements are true about the map and
therefore they are true about the matrix. QED
4.4 Lemma A product of invertible matrices is invertible: ifG andH are invertible
andGH is deﬁned thenGH is invertible and(GH)−1 =H−1G−1.
Proof Because the two matrices are invertible they are square, and because
their product is deﬁned they must both ben×n. Fix spaces and bases—say,
Rn with the standard bases—to get mapsg,h : Rn→ Rn that are associated
with the matrices,G = RepEn,En (g) andH = RepEn,En (h).
Considerh−1g−1. By the prior paragraph this composition is deﬁned. This
map is a two-sided inverse ofgh since (h−1g−1)(gh) =h−1(id)h =h−1h = id
and (gh)(h−1g−1) = g(id)g−1 = gg−1 = id. The matrices representing the
maps reﬂect this equality. QED
This is the arrow diagram giving the relationship between map inverses and
matrix inverses. It is a special case of the diagram relating function composition
to matrix multiplication.

Beyond its place in our program of seeing how to represent map operations,
another reason for our interest in inverses comes from linear systems. A linear
system is equivalent to a matrix equation, as here.
x1 +x2 =3
2x1 −x2 =2 ⇐⇒
(
1 1
2 −1
)(
x1
x2
)
=
(
3
2
)
By ﬁxing spaces and bases (for instance,R2, R2 with the standard bases), we
take the matrixH to represent a maph. The matrix equation then becomes
this linear map equation.
h(⃗x) = ⃗d
If we had a left inverse mapg then we could apply it to both sidesg◦h(⃗x) =g(⃗d)
to get ⃗x =g(⃗d). Restating in terms of the matrices, we want to multiply by the
inverse matrix RepC,B(g)·RepC(⃗d) to get RepB(⃗x).
Section IV. Matrix Operations 257
4.5 Example We can ﬁnd a left inverse for the matrix just given
(
m n
p q
)(
1 1
2 −1
)
=
(
1 0
0 1
)
by using Gauss’s Method to solve the resulting linear system.
m +2n =1
m − n =0
p +2q =0
p − q =1
Answer: m =1/3,n =1/3,p =2/3, andq = −1/3. (This matrix is actually
the two-sided inverse ofH; the check is easy.) With it, we can solve the system
from the prior example.

)
4.6 Remark Why solve systems with inverse matrices when we have Gauss’s
Method? Beyond the conceptual appeal of representing the map inverse opera-
tion, solving linear systems this way has two advantages.
First, once we have done the work of ﬁnding an inverse then solving a
system with the same coeﬃcients but diﬀerent constants is fast: if we change
the constants on the right of the system above then we get a related problem
(
1 1
2 −1
)(
x
y
)
=
(

)
that our inverse method solves quickly.

y
)
=
(
1/3 1/3
2/3 −1/3
)(
5
1
)
=
(
2
3
)
Another advantage of inverses is that we can explore a system’s sensitivity
to changes in the constants. For example, tweaking the3 on the right of the
prior example’s system to
(
1 1
2 −1
)(
x1
x2
)
=
(
3.01
2
)
and solving with the inverse
(
1/3 1/3
2/3 −1/3
)(
3.01
2
)
=
(
(1/3)(3.01) + (1/3)(2)
(2/3)(3.01) − (1/3)(2)
)
258 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
shows that the ﬁrst component of the solution changes by1/3 of the tweak,
while the second component moves by2/3 of the tweak. This issensitivity
analysis. We could use it to decide how accurately we must specify the data in
a linear model to ensure that the solution has a desired accuracy.
4.7 Lemma A matrixH is invertible if and only if it can be written as the product
of elementary reduction matrices. We can compute the inverse by applying to
the identity matrix the same row steps, in the same order, that Gauss-Jordan
reduceH.
Proof The matrixH is invertible if and only if it is nonsingular and thus
Gauss-Jordan reduces to the identity. By Corollary 3.23 we can do this reduction
with elementary matrices.
Rr·Rr−1...R 1·H =I (∗)
Fortheﬁrstsentenceoftheresult, notethatelementarymatricesareinvertible
because elementary row operations are reversible, and that their inverses are also
elementary. ApplyR−1
r from the left to both sides of (∗). Then applyR−1
r−1, etc.
The result givesH as the product of elementary matricesH =R−1
1 ··· R−1
r ·I.
(TheI there covers the caser =0.)
For the second sentence, group (∗) as (Rr·Rr−1...R 1)·H =I and recognize
what’s in the parentheses as the inverseH−1 =Rr·Rr−1...R 1·I. Restated:
applyingR1 to the identity, followed byR2, etc., yields the inverse ofH. QED
4.8 Example To ﬁnd the inverse of
(

do Gauss-Jordan reduction, meanwhile performing the same operations on
the identity. For clerical convenience we write the matrix and the identity
side-by-side and do the reduction steps together.

We have seen in this subsection, as in the subsection on Mechanics of Matrix
Multiplication, how to exploit the correspondence between linear maps and
matrices. We can fruitfully study both maps and matrices, translating back and
forth to use whichever is handiest.
Over the course of this entire section we have developed an algebra system
for matrices. We can compare it with the familiar algebra of real numbers.
Matrix addition and subtraction work in much the same way as the real number
operations except that they only combine same-sized matrices. Scalar multipli-
cation is in some ways an extension of real number multiplication. We also have
a matrix multiplication operation and its inverse that are somewhat like the
familiar real number operations (associativity, and distributivity over addition,
260 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
for example), but there are diﬀerences (failure of commutativity). This section
provides an example that algebra systems other than the usual real number one
can be interesting and useful.

V Change of Basis
Representations vary with the bases. For instance, with respect to the basesE2
and
B =⟨
(

,
(
1

)
⟩
⃗e1∈ R2 has these diﬀerent representations.
RepE2 (⃗e1) =
(

0
)
RepB(⃗e1) =
(
1/2

)
The same holds for maps: with respect to the basis pairsE2, E2 and E2,B, the
identity map has these representations.
RepE2,E2 (id) =
(
1 0
0 1
)
RepE2,B(id) =
(
1/2 1/2
1/2 −1/2
)
This section shows how to translate among the representations. That is, we will
compute how the representations vary as the bases vary.
V.1 Changing Representations of Vectors
In convertingRepB(⃗v) to RepD(⃗v) the underlying vector⃗v doesn’t change. Thus,
the translation between these two ways of expressing the vector is accomplished
by the identity map on the space, described so that the domain space vectors are
represented with respect toB and the codomain space vectors are represented
with respect toD.

1.2 Remark A better name would be ‘change of representation matrix’ but the
above name is standard.
The next result supports the deﬁnition.
1.3 Lemma To convert from the representation of a vector⃗v with respect toB
to its representation with respect toD use the change of basis matrix.
RepB,D(id)RepB(⃗v) = RepD(⃗v)
Conversely, if left-multiplication by a matrix changes basesM· RepB(⃗v) =
RepD(⃗v) thenM is a change of basis matrix.
Proof The ﬁrst sentence holds because matrix-vector multiplication represents
a map application and soRepB,D(id)·RepB(⃗v) = RepD(id(⃗v) ) = RepD(⃗v) for
each ⃗v. For the second sentence, with respect toB,D the matrixM represents
a linear map whose action is to map each vector to itself, and is therefore the
identity map. QED

Checking that vector on the right is RepD(⃗e2) is easy.
264 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
We ﬁnish this subsection by recognizing the change of basis matrices as a
familiar set.
1.5 Lemma A matrix changes bases if and only if it is nonsingular.
Proof For the ‘only if’ direction, if left-multiplication by a matrix changes
bases then the matrix represents an invertible function, simply because we can
invert the function by changing the bases back. Because it represents a function
that is invertible, the matrix itself is invertible, and so is nonsingular.
For ‘if’ we will show that any nonsingular matrixM performs a change of
basis operation from any given starting basisB (havingn vectors, where the
matrix isn×n) to some ending basis.
If the matrix is the identityI then the statement is obvious. Otherwise
because the matrix is nonsingular Corollary IV.3.23 says there are elementary
reduction matrices such thatRr··· R1·M =I withr >1. Elementary matrices
are invertible and their inverses are also elementary so multiplying both sides of
that equation from the left byRr
−1, then byRr−1
−1, etc., givesM as a product
of elementary matricesM =R1
−1··· Rr
−1.
We will be done if we show that elementary matrices change a given basis to
another basis, since thenRr
−1 changesB to some other basisBr andRr−1
−1
changes Br to someBr−1, etc. We will cover the three types of elementary
matrices separately; recall the notation for the three.

V.2 Changing Map Representations
The ﬁrst subsection shows how to convert the representation of a vector with
respect to one basis to the representation of that same vector with respect to
another basis. We next convert the representation of a map with respect to one
pair of bases to the representation with respect to a diﬀerent pair—we convert
from RepB,D(h) to RepˆB,ˆD(h). Here is the arrow diagram.

h

Wwrt ˆD
To move from the lower-left to the lower-right we can either go straight over,
or else up toVB then over toWD and then down. So we can calculateˆH =
RepˆB,ˆD(h) either by directly usingˆB and ˆD, or else by ﬁrst changing bases with
RepˆB,B(id) then multiplying byH = RepB,D(h) and then changing bases with
RepD,ˆD(id).
2.1 Theorem To convert from the matrixH representing a maph with respect
toB,D to the matrixˆH representing it with respect toˆB, ˆD use this formula.
ˆH = RepD,ˆD(id)·H·RepˆB,B(id) (∗)
Proof This is evident from the diagram. QED

The picture illustrates that we can computeˆT either directly by going along the
square’s bottom, or as in formula (∗) by going up on the left, then across the
top, and then down on the right, withˆT = RepE2,ˆD(id)·T·RepˆB,E2
(id). (Note
again that the matrix multiplication reads right to left, as the three functions
are composed and function composition reads right to left.)
Find the matrix for the left-hand side, the matrixRepˆB,E2
(id), in the usual
way: ﬁnd the eﬀect of the identity matrix on the starting basisˆB—which is
no eﬀect at all—and then represent those basis elements with respect to the
ending basis E2.
RepˆB,E2
(id) =
(
1 0
1 2
)
This calculation is easy when the ending basis is the standard one.
There are two ways to compute the matrix for going down the square’s right
side, RepE2,ˆD(id). We could calculate it directly as we did for the other change
of basis matrix. Or, we could instead calculate it as the inverse of the matrix
Section V. Change of Basis 269
for going upRepˆD,E2
(id). That matrix is easy to ﬁnd and we have a formula
for the2×2 inverse, so that’s what is in the equation below.

Naturally we usually prefer representations that are easier to understand.
We say that a map or matrix has beendiagonalized when we ﬁnd a basisB such
that the representation is diagonal with respect toB,B, that is, with respect
to the same starting basis as ending basis. Chapter Five ﬁnds which maps and
matrices are diagonalizable.
The rest of this subsection develops the easier case of ﬁnding two basesB,D
such that a representation is simple. Recall that the prior subsection shows that
a matrix is a change of basis matrix if and only if it is nonsingular.
2.4 DeﬁnitionSame-sized matricesH and ˆH are matrix equivalentif there are
nonsingular matricesP andQ such that ˆH =PHQ.
2.5 Corollary Matrix equivalent matrices represent the same map, with respect
to appropriate pairs of bases.
Proof This is immediate from equation (∗) above. QED
Exercise 24 checks that matrix equivalence is an equivalence relation. Thus
it partitions the set of matrices into matrix equivalence classes.
All matrices:
...
H
ˆH
H matrix equivalent
to ˆH
We can get insight into the classes by comparing matrix equivalence with row
equivalence (remember that matrices are row equivalent when they can be
reduced to each other by row operations). InˆH =PHQ, the matricesP andQ
are nonsingular and thus each is a product of elementary reduction matrices
by Lemma IV.4.7. Left-multiplication by the reduction matrices making upP
performs row operations. Right-multiplication by the reduction matrices making
upQ performs column operations. Hence, matrix equivalence is a generalization
of row equivalence—two matrices are row equivalent if one can be converted to
the other by a sequence of row reduction steps, while two matrices are matrix
equivalent if one can be converted to the other by a sequence of row reduction
steps followed by a sequence of column reduction steps.
Consequently, if matrices are row equivalent then they are also matrix
equivalent since we can takeQ to be the identity matrix. The converse, however,
does not hold: two matrices can be matrix equivalent but not row equivalent.
2.6 Example These two are matrix equivalent
(

0 0
) (
1 1
0 0
)
Section V. Change of Basis 271
because the second reduces to the ﬁrst by the column operation of taking−1
times the ﬁrst column and adding to the second. They are not row equivalent
because they have diﬀerent reduced echelon forms (both are already in reduced
form).
We close this section by giving a set of representatives for the matrix equiva-
lence classes.

Proof Gauss-Jordan reduce the given matrix and combine all the row reduction
matrices to makeP. Then use the leading entries to do column reduction and
ﬁnish by swapping the columns to put the leading ones on the diagonal. Combine
the column reduction matrices intoQ. QED

2.9 Corollary Matrix equivalence classes are characterized by rank: two same-sized
matrices are matrix equivalent if and only if they have the same rank.
Proof Two same-sized matrices with the same rank are equivalent to the same
block partial-identity matrix. QED

classes
Each class consists of all of the2×2 matrices with the same rank. There is
only one rank zero matrix. The other two classes have inﬁnitely many members;
we’ve shown only the canonical representative.
One nice thing about the representative in Theorem 2.7 is that we can
completely understand the linear map when it is expressed in this way: where
the bases areB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ andD =⟨⃗δ1,..., ⃗δm⟩ then the map’s action is
c1⃗β1 +··· +ck⃗βk +ck+1⃗βk+1 +··· +cn⃗βn ↦→ c1⃗δ1 +··· +ck⃗δk + ⃗0 +··· + ⃗0
wherek is the rank. Thus we can view any linear map as a projection.

VI Projection
This section is optional. It is a prerequisite only for the ﬁnal two sections
of Chapter Five, and some Topics.
We have described projection fromR3 into itsxy-plane subspace as a shadow
map. This shows why but it also shows that some shadows fall upward.

So perhaps a better description is: the projection of⃗v is the vector⃗p in the plane
with the property that someone standing on⃗p and looking straight up or down—
that is, looking orthogonally to the plane—sees the tip of⃗v. In this section we
will generalize this to other projections, orthogonal and non-orthogonal.
VI.1 Orthogonal Projection Into a Line
We ﬁrst consider orthogonal projection of a vector⃗v into a line𝓁. This shows
a ﬁgure walking out on the line to a point⃗p such that the tip of⃗v is directly
above them, where “above” does not mean parallel to they-axis but instead
means orthogonal to the line.
Since the line is the span of some vector𝓁 = {c· ⃗s |c∈ R }, we have a coeﬃcient
c⃗p with the property that⃗v −c⃗p⃗s is orthogonal toc⃗p⃗s.
c⃗p ⃗s
⃗v ⃗v −c⃗p ⃗s
276 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
To solve for this coeﬃcient, observe that because⃗v −c⃗p⃗s is orthogonal to a
scalar multiple of⃗s, it must be orthogonal to⃗s itself. Then (⃗v −c⃗p⃗s)•⃗s =0
gives thatc⃗p = ⃗v•⃗s/⃗s•⃗s.
1.1 Deﬁnition The orthogonal projection of ⃗v into the line spanned by a
nonzero ⃗s is this vector.
proj[⃗s ](⃗v) = ⃗v•⃗s
⃗s•⃗s· ⃗s
(That says ‘spanned by⃗s’ instead the more formal ‘span of the set{⃗s }’. This
more casual phrase is common.)

(2

into the liney =2x, ﬁrst
pick a direction vector for the line.
⃗s =

which matches our intuitive expectation.
The picture above showing the ﬁgure walking out on the line until⃗v’s tip is
overhead is one way to think of the orthogonal projection of a vector into a line.
We ﬁnish this subsection with two other ways.
Section VI. Projection 277
1.4 Example A railroad car left on an east-west track without its brake is pushed
by a wind blowing toward the northeast at ﬁfteen miles per hour; what speed
will the car reach?
For the wind we use a vector of length15 that points toward the northeast.
⃗v =
(
15
√
1/2
15
√
1/2
)
The car is only aﬀected by the part of the wind blowing in the east-west
direction—the part of ⃗v in the direction of thex-axis is this (the picture has
the same perspective as the railroad car picture above).
east
north
⃗p =
(
15
√
1/2
0
)
So the car will reach a velocity of15
√
1/2 miles per hour toward the east.
Thus, another way to think of the picture that precedes the deﬁnition is that
it shows⃗v as decomposed into two parts, the part⃗p with the line, and the part
that is orthogonal to the line (shown above on the north-south axis). These
two are non-interacting in the sense that the east-west car is not at all aﬀected
by the north-south part of the wind (see Exercise 10). So we can think of the
orthogonal projection of⃗v into the line spanned by⃗s as the part of⃗v that lies
in the direction of⃗s.
Still another useful way to think of orthogonal projection into a line is to
have the person stand on the vector, not the line. This person holds a rope
looped over the line. As they pull, the loop slides on the line.
When it is tight, the rope is orthogonal to the line. That is, we can think of the
projection ⃗p as being the vector in the line that is closest to⃗v (see Exercise 17).
1.5 Example A submarine is tracking a ship moving along the liney =3x +2.
Torpedo range is one-half mile. If the sub stays where it is, at the origin on the
chart below, will the ship pass within range?
278 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
east
north
The formula for projection into a line does not immediately apply because the
line doesn’t pass through the origin, and so isn’t the span of any⃗s. To adjust
for this, we start by shifting the entire map down two units. Now the line is
y =3x, a subspace. We project to get the point⃗p on the line closest to
⃗v =
(

)
the sub’s shifted position.

1.10 Example 1.4 suggests that projection breaks⃗v into two parts,proj[⃗s ](⃗v ) and

that any two nonzero orthogonal vectors make up a linearly independent set.

point in the line closest to⃗v.
1.18 Prove that the orthogonal projection of a vector into a line has length less than
or equal to that of the vector.
✓ 1.19 Show that the deﬁnition of orthogonal projection into a line does not depend
on the spanning vector: if⃗s is a nonzero multiple of⃗q then (⃗v•⃗s/⃗s•⃗s )· ⃗s equals
(⃗v•⃗q/⃗q•⃗q )· ⃗q.
1.20 Consider the function mapping the plane to itself that takes a vector to its
projection into the liney =x. These two each show that the map is linear, the ﬁrst
one in a way that is coordinate-bound (that is, it ﬁxes a basis and then computes)
and the second in a way that is more conceptual.
(a) Produce a matrix that describes the function’s action.
(b) Show that we can obtain this map by ﬁrst rotating everything in the plane
π/4 radians clockwise, then projecting into thex-axis, and then rotatingπ/4 ra-
dians counterclockwise.
1.21 For ⃗a, ⃗b∈ Rn let ⃗v1 be the projection of⃗a into the line spanned by⃗b, let⃗v2 be
the projection of⃗v1 into the line spanned by⃗a, let ⃗v3 be the projection of⃗v2 into
the line spanned by⃗b, etc., back and forth between the spans of⃗a and ⃗b. That is,
⃗vi+1 is the projection of⃗vi into the span of⃗a ifi +1 is even, and into the span
of ⃗b ifi +1 is odd. Must that sequence of vectors eventually settle down—must
there be a suﬃciently largei such that⃗vi+2 equals ⃗vi and ⃗vi+3 equals ⃗vi+1? If so,
what is the earliest suchi?

VI.2 Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization
The prior subsection suggests that projecting ⃗v into the line spanned by ⃗s
decomposes that vector into two parts
proj[⃗s](⃗p)
⃗v ⃗v −proj[⃗s](⃗p)
⃗v = proj[⃗s ](⃗v) +
(
⃗v −proj[⃗s ](⃗v)
)
that are orthogonal and so are “non-interacting.” We now develop that suggestion.
2.1 DeﬁnitionVectors ⃗v1,..., ⃗vk∈ Rn are mutually orthogonal when any two
are orthogonal: ifi⁄=j then the dot product⃗vi•⃗vj is zero.
2.2 Theorem If the vectors in a set{⃗v1,..., ⃗vk }⊂ Rn are mutually orthogonal
and nonzero then that set is linearly independent.
Proof Consider ⃗0 =c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2 +··· +ck⃗vk. Fori∈ {1,..,k }, taking the dot
product of⃗vi with both sides of the equation⃗vi•(c1⃗v1 +c2⃗v2 +··· +ck⃗vk) = ⃗vi•⃗0,
which givesci· (⃗vi•⃗vi) =0, shows thatci =0 since ⃗vi⁄= ⃗0. QED
2.3 Corollary In ak dimensional vector space, if the vectors in a sizek set are
mutually orthogonal and nonzero then that set is a basis for the space.
Proof Any linearly independent sizek subset of ak dimensional space is a
basis. QED
Of course, the converse of Corollary 2.3 does not hold—not every basis of
every subspace ofRn has mutually orthogonal vectors. However, we can get
the partial converse that for every subspace ofRn there is at least one basis
consisting of mutually orthogonal vectors.
2.4 Example The members ⃗β1 and ⃗β2 of this basis forR2 are not orthogonal.

orthogonal vectors. The ﬁrst member of the new basis is just⃗β1.
⃗κ1 =
(
4

)
Section VI. Projection 281
For the second member of the new basis, we subtract from⃗β2 the part in the
direction of ⃗κ1. This leaves the part of⃗β2 that is orthogonal to⃗κ1.

2.7 Theorem (Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization) If⟨⃗β1,... ⃗βk⟩ is a basis for a sub-
space of Rn then the vectors
⃗κ1 = ⃗β1
⃗κ2 = ⃗β2 −proj[⃗κ1](⃗β2)
⃗κ3 = ⃗β3 −proj[⃗κ1](⃗β3) −proj[⃗κ2](⃗β3)
...
⃗κk = ⃗βk −proj[⃗κ1](⃗βk) −··· −proj[⃗κk−1](⃗βk)
form an orthogonal basis for the same subspace.
2.8 Remark This is restricted toRn only because we have not given a deﬁnition
of orthogonality for other spaces.
Proof We will use induction to check that each⃗κi is nonzero, is in the span of
⟨⃗β1,... ⃗βi⟩, and is orthogonal to all preceding vectors⃗κ1•⃗κi =··· = ⃗κi−1•⃗κi =0.
Then Corollary 2.3 gives that⟨⃗κ1,... ⃗κk⟩ is a basis for the same space as is the
starting basis.
We shall only cover the cases up toi =3, to give the sense of the argument.
The full argument is Exercise 28.
Thei =1 case is trivial; taking⃗κ1 to be ⃗β1 makes it a nonzero vector since
⃗β1 is a member of a basis, it is obviously in the span of⟨⃗β1⟩, and the ‘orthogonal
to all preceding vectors’ condition is satisﬁed vacuously.
In thei =2 case the expansion
⃗κ2 = ⃗β2 −proj[⃗κ1](⃗β2) = ⃗β2 −
⃗β2•⃗κ1
⃗κ1•⃗κ1
· ⃗κ1 = ⃗β2 −
⃗β2•⃗κ1
⃗κ1•⃗κ1
· ⃗β1
shows that⃗κ2⁄= ⃗0 or else this would be a non-trivial linear dependence among
the ⃗β’s (it is nontrivial because the coeﬃcient of⃗β2 is1). It also shows that⃗κ2
is in the span of⟨⃗β1, ⃗β2⟩. And, ⃗κ2 is orthogonal to the only preceding vector
⃗κ1•⃗κ2 = ⃗κ1•(⃗β2 −proj[⃗κ1](⃗β2)) =0
because this projection is orthogonal.
Thei =3 case is the same as thei =2 case except for one detail. As in the
i =2 case, expand the deﬁnition.
⃗κ3 = ⃗β3 −
⃗β3•⃗κ1
⃗κ1•⃗κ1

(⃗β2 −
⃗β2•⃗κ1
⃗κ1•⃗κ1
· ⃗β1
)
Section VI. Projection 283
By the ﬁrst line⃗κ3⁄= ⃗0, since ⃗β3 isn’t in the span[⃗β1, ⃗β2] and therefore by the
inductive hypothesis it isn’t in the span[⃗κ1, ⃗κ2]. By the second line⃗κ3 is in
the span of the ﬁrst three⃗β’s. Finally, the calculation below shows that⃗κ3 is
orthogonal to ⃗κ1.
⃗κ1•⃗κ3 = ⃗κ1•( ⃗β3 −proj[⃗κ1](⃗β3) −proj[⃗κ2](⃗β3)
)
= ⃗κ1•(⃗β3 −proj[⃗κ1](⃗β3)
)
− ⃗κ1•proj[⃗κ2](⃗β3)
=0
(Here is the diﬀerence with thei =2 case: as happened fori =2 the ﬁrst term
is0 because this projection is orthogonal, but here the second term in the second
line is0 because ⃗κ1 is orthogonal to⃗κ2 and so is orthogonal to any vector in
the line spanned by⃗κ2.) A similar check shows that⃗κ3 is also orthogonal to⃗κ2.
QED
In addition to having the vectors in the basis be orthogonal, we can also
normalize each vector by dividing by its length, to end with anorthonormal
basis..

this orthonormal basis.

VI.3 Projection Into a Subspace
This subsection uses material from the optional earlier subsection on Com-
bining Subspaces.
The prior subsections project a vector into a line by decomposing it into two
parts: the part in the lineproj[⃗s ](⃗v ) and the rest⃗v −proj[⃗s ](⃗v ). To generalize
projection to arbitrary subspaces we will follow this decomposition idea.
286 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
3.1 DeﬁnitionLet a vector space be a direct sumV =M⊕N. Then for any
⃗v∈V with ⃗v = ⃗m + ⃗n where ⃗m∈M, ⃗n∈N, theprojection of⃗v into M along
N is projM,N(⃗v ) = ⃗m.
This deﬁnition applies in spaces where we don’t have a ready deﬁnition
of orthogonal. (Deﬁnitions of orthogonality for spaces other than theRn are
perfectly possible but we haven’t seen any in this book.)
3.2 Example The space M2×2 of2×2 matrices is the direct sum of these two.

So projecting along diﬀerent subspaces can give diﬀerent results.
These pictures compare the two maps. Both show that the projection is
indeed ‘into’ the plane and ‘along’ the line.

Notice that the projection alongN is not orthogonal since there are members
of the planeM that are not orthogonal to the dotted line. But the projection
along ˆN is orthogonal.
We have seen two projection operations, orthogonal projection into a line as
well as this subsections’s projection into anM and along anN, and we naturally
ask whether they are related. The right-hand picture above suggests the answer—
orthogonal projection into a line is a special case of this subsection’s projection;
it is projection along a subspace perpendicular to the line.

3.4 DeﬁnitionThe orthogonal complementof a subspaceM of Rn is
M⊥ = {⃗v∈ Rn | ⃗v is perpendicular to all vectors inM}
(read “M perp”). Theorthogonal projectionprojM(⃗v ) of a vector is its projec-
tion intoM alongM⊥.
3.5 Example In R3, to ﬁnd the orthogonal complement of the plane
P = {





we start with a basis forP.

Any ⃗v perpendicular to every vector inB is perpendicular to every vector in the
span ofB (the proof of this is Exercise 22). Therefore, the subspaceP⊥ consists
Section VI. Projection 289
of the vectors that satisfy these two conditions.

We are thus left with ﬁnding the null space of the map represented by the matrix,
that is, with calculating the solution set of the homogeneous linear system.

3.6 Example WhereM is thexy-plane subspace ofR3, what isM⊥? A common
ﬁrst reaction is thatM⊥ is theyz-plane but that’s not right because some
vectors from theyz-plane are not perpendicular to every vector in thexy-plane.

3.7 Lemma IfM is a subspace ofRn then its orthogonal complementM⊥ is also
a subspace. The space is the direct sum of the twoRn =M⊕M⊥. For any
⃗v∈ Rn the vector⃗v −projM(⃗v ) is perpendicular to every vector inM.
Proof First, the orthogonal complementM⊥ is a subspace ofRn because it is
a null space, namely the null space of the orthogonal projection map.
To show that the spaceRn is the direct sum of the two, start with any basis
BM =⟨⃗µ1,..., ⃗µk⟩ forM. Expand it to a basis for the entire space and then
290 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
apply the Gram-Schmidt process to get an orthogonal basisK =⟨⃗κ1,..., ⃗κn⟩
for Rn. ThisK is the concatenation of two bases:⟨⃗κ1,..., ⃗κk⟩ with the same
number of members,k, asBM, andD =⟨⃗κk+1,..., ⃗κn⟩. The ﬁrst is a basis for
M so if we show that the second is a basis forM⊥ then we will have that the
entire space is the direct sum.
Exercise 22 from the prior subsection proves this about any orthogonal
basis: each vector⃗v in the space is the sum of its orthogonal projections into
the lines spanned by the basis vectors.
⃗v = proj[⃗κ1](⃗v ) +··· +proj[⃗κn](⃗v ) (∗)
To check this, represent the vector as⃗v =r1⃗κ1 +··· +rn⃗κn, apply ⃗κi to both
sides ⃗v•⃗κi = (r1⃗κ1 +··· +rn⃗κn)•⃗κi =r1·0 +··· +ri· (⃗κi•⃗κi) +··· +rn·0,
and solve to getri = (⃗v•⃗κi)/(⃗κi•⃗κi), as desired.
Any member of the span ofD is orthogonal to any vector inM so the span
ofD is a subset ofM⊥. To show thatD is a basis forM⊥ we need only show
the other containment, that any⃗w∈M⊥ is an element of the span ofD. The
prior paragraph works for this. Any⃗w∈M⊥ gives this on projections into basis
vectors fromM: proj[⃗κ1](⃗w ) = ⃗0,..., proj[⃗κk](⃗w ) = ⃗0. Therefore equation (∗)
gives that ⃗w is a linear combination of⃗κk+1,..., ⃗κn. ThusD is a basis forM⊥
and Rn is the direct sum of the two.
The ﬁnal sentence of the lemma is proved in much the same way. Write
⃗v = proj[⃗κ1](⃗v ) +··· + proj[⃗κn](⃗v ). Then projM(⃗v ) keeps only theM part
and drops theM⊥ part: projM(⃗v ) = proj[⃗κ1](⃗v ) +··· +proj[⃗κk](⃗v ). Therefore
⃗v − projM(⃗v ) consists of a linear combination of elements ofM⊥ and so is
perpendicular to every vector inM. QED
Given a subspace, we could compute the orthogonal projection into that
subspace by following the steps of that proof: ﬁnding a basis, expanding it
to a basis for the entire space, applying Gram-Schmidt to get an orthogonal
basis, and projecting into each linear subspace. However we will instead use a
convenient formula.
3.8 Theorem LetM be a subspace ofRn with basis⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βk⟩ and letA be
the matrix whose columns are the⃗β’s. Then for any⃗v∈ Rn the orthogonal
projection is projM(⃗v ) = c1⃗β1 +··· +ck⃗βk, where the coeﬃcientsci are the
entries of the vector(ATA)−1AT· ⃗v. That is, projM(⃗v ) =A(ATA)−1AT· ⃗v.
Proof The vectorprojM(⃗v) is a member ofM and so is a linear combination
of basis vectorsc1· ⃗β1 +··· +ck· ⃗βk. SinceA’s columns are the⃗β’s, there is a
⃗c∈ Rk such that projM(⃗v ) =A⃗c. To ﬁnd⃗c note that the vector⃗v −projM(⃗v )
Section VI. Projection 291
is perpendicular to each member of the basis so
⃗0 =AT(
⃗v −A⃗c
)
=AT⃗v −ATA⃗c
and solving gives this (showing thatATA is invertible is an exercise).
⃗c =
(
ATA
)−1
AT· ⃗v
Therefore projM(⃗v ) =A· ⃗c =A(ATA)−1AT· ⃗v, as required. QED

Scientists are often presented with a system that has no solution and they
must ﬁnd an answer anyway. More precisely, they must ﬁnd a best answer.
For instance, this is the result of ﬂipping a penny, including some intermediate
numbers.
number of ﬂips 30 60 90
number of heads 16 34 51
Because of the randomness in this experiment we expect that the ratio of heads
to ﬂips will ﬂuctuate around a penny’s long-term ratio of 50-50. So the system
for such an experiment likely has no solution, and that’s what happened here.

The estimate (m =7110/12600≈0.56) is a bit more than one half, but not
much more than half, so probably the penny is fair enough.

Minimizing the distance between the given vector and the vector used as the
right-hand side minimizes the total of these vertical lengths, and consequently
we say that the line comes fromﬁtting by least-squares.
This diagram exaggerates the vertical scale by a factor of ten to make the lengths
more visible.
In the above equation the line must pass through(0,0 ), because we take it
to be the line whose slope is this coin’s true proportion of heads to ﬂips. We
can also handle cases where the line need not pass through the origin.
Here is the progression of world record times for the men’s mile race
[Oakley & Baker]. In the early 1900’s many people wondered when, or if, this
record would fall below the four minute mark. Here are the times that were in
force on January ﬁrst of each decade through the ﬁrst half of that century.
year 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950
secs 268.8 264.5 258.4 255.6 255.6 252.6 250.4 246.4 241.4
We can use this to give a circa 1950 prediction of the date for240 seconds, and
then compare that to the actual date. As with the penny data, these numbers
do not lie in a perfect line. That is, this system does not have an exact solution
for the slope and intercept.
b +1870m =268.8
b +1880m =264.5
...
b +1950m =241.4
We ﬁnd a best approximation by using orthogonal projection.
(Comments on the data.Restricting to the times at the start of each decade

the same result as entering all of the dates and records. There are diﬀerent
sequences of times from competing standards bodies but the ones here are from
[Wikipedia, Mens Mile]. We’ve started the plot at 1870 because at one point
there were two classes of records, called ‘professional’ and ‘amateur’, and after a
while the ﬁrst class stopped being active so we’ve followed the second class.)

Judging this line by eye would be error-prone. So the equations give us a
certainty about the ‘best’ in best ﬁt. In addition, the model’s equation tells us
roughly that by spending an additional million dollars a team owner can expect
to buy1/4 of a win (and that expectation is not very sure, thank goodness).

calibrates the toll for each bridge across the Hudson, playing oﬀ the extra gas to
get there from New York City against a lower crossing cost, to encourage people to
go upstate. This table, from [Cost Of Tolls] and [Google Maps], lists for each toll
crossing of the Hudson River, the distance to drive from Times Square in miles
and the cost in US dollars for a passenger car (if a crossings has a one-way toll
then it shows half that number).

Find the line of best ﬁt and graph the data to show that the driver was practicing

7 When the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986, one of the criticisms made
of NASA’s decision to launch was in the way they did the analysis of number of
O-ring failures versus temperature (O-ring failure caused the explosion). Four
O-ring failures would be fatal. NASA had data from24 previous ﬂights.
temp ◦F 53 75 57 58 63 70 70 66 67 67 67

The temperature that day was forecast to be31◦F.
(a) NASA based the decision to launch partially on a chart showing only the
ﬂights that had at least one O-ring failure. Find the line that best ﬁts these
seven ﬂights. On the basis of this data, predict the number of O-ring failures
when the temperature is31, and when the number of failures will exceed four.
(b) Find the line that best ﬁts all 24 ﬂights. On the basis of this extra data,
predict the number of O-ring failures when the temperature is31, and when the
number of failures will exceed four.
Which do you think is the more accurate method of predicting? (An excellent
discussion is in [Dalal, et. al.].)

Each of the four pictures shows the domainR on the left mapped to the codomain
R on the right. Arrows trace where each map sendsx =0,x =1,x =2,x = −1,
andx = −2.
The nonlinear maps distort the domain in transforming it into the range. For
302 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
instance,f1(1) is further fromf1(2) than it is fromf1(0)—this map spreads the
domain out unevenly so that a domain interval nearx =2 is spread apart more
than is a domain interval nearx =0. The linear maps are nicer, more regular,
in that for each map all of the domain spreads by the same factor. The maph1
on the left spreads all intervals apart to be twice as wide while on the righth2
keeps intervals the same length but reverses their orientation, as with the rising
interval from1 to2 being transformed to the falling interval from−1 to −2.
The only linear maps fromR to R are multiplications by a scalar but in
higher dimensions more can happen. For instance, this linear transformation of
R2 rotates vectors counterclockwise.

Despite this additional variety, even in higher dimensions linear maps behave
nicely. Consider a linearh : Rn→ Rm and use the standard bases to represent it
by a matrixH. Recall from Theorem V.2.7 thatH factors intoH =PBQ whereP
andQ are nonsingular andB is a partial-identity matrix. Recall also that nonsin-
gular matrices factor into elementary matricesPBQ =TnTn−1··· TsBTs−1··· T1,
which are matrices that come from the identityI after one Gaussian row opera-
tion, so eachT matrix is one of these three kinds
I
kρi
−→ Mi(k) I
ρi↔ρj
−→ Pi,j I
kρi+ρj
−→ Ci,j(k)
with i⁄= j, k⁄= 0. So if we understand the geometric eﬀect of a linear map
described by a partial-identity matrix and the eﬀect of the linear maps described
by the elementary matrices then we will in some sense completely understand
the eﬀect of any linear map. (The pictures below stick to transformations ofR2
for ease of drawing but the principles extend for maps from anyRn to any Rm.)

Any vector with a ﬁrst component of1 would be aﬀected in the same way as
⃗u: it would slide up by2. And any vector with a ﬁrst component of2 would
slide up4, as was⃗v. That is, the transformation represented byCi,j(k) aﬀects
vectors depending on theiri-th component.
Another way to see this point is to consider the action of this map on the
unit square. In the next picture, vectors with a ﬁrst component of0, such as the
origin, are not pushed vertically at all but vectors with a positive ﬁrst component
slide up. Here, all vectors with a ﬁrst component of1, the entire right side of
the square, slide to the same extent. In general, vectors on the same vertical
line slide by the same amount, by twice their ﬁrst component. The resulting
shape has the same base and height as the square (and thus the same area) but
the right angle corners are gone.

In general, for anyCi,j(k), the sliding happens so that vectors with the same
i-th component are slid by the same amount. This kind of map is ashear.
With that we understand the geometric eﬀect of the four types of matrices
on the right-hand side ofH =TnTn−1··· TjBTj−1··· T1 and so in some sense we
understand the action of any matrixH. Thus, even in higher dimensions the
geometry of linear maps is easy: it is built by putting together a number of
components, each of which acts in a simple way.
We will apply this understanding in two ways. The ﬁrst way is to prove
something general about the geometry of linear maps. Recall that under a linear
map, the image of a subspace is a subspace and thus the linear transformation
h represented byH maps lines through the origin to lines through the origin.
(The dimension of the image space cannot be greater than the dimension of the
domain space, so a line can’t map onto, say, a plane.) We will show thath maps
any line—not just one through the origin—to a line. The proof is simple: the
partial-identity projectionB and the elementaryTi’s each turn a line input into
a line output; verifying the four cases is Exercise 5. Therefore their composition
also preserves lines.
Topic: Geometry of Linear Maps 305
The second way that we will apply the geometric understanding of linear
maps is to elucidate a point from Calculus. Below is a picture of the action of
the one-variable real functiony(x) = x2 +x. As with the nonlinear functions
pictured earlier, the geometric eﬀect of this map is irregular in that at diﬀerent
domain points it has diﬀerent eﬀects; for example as the inputx goes from2 to
−2, the associated outputf(x) at ﬁrst decreases, then pauses for an instant, and
then increases.

But in Calculus we focus less on the map overall and more on the local eﬀect
of the map. Below we look closely at what this map does nearx = 1. The
derivative isdy/dx =2x +1 so that nearx =1 we have∆y≈3·∆x. That is, in
a neighborhood ofx =1, in carrying the domain over this map causes it to grow
by a factor of3—it is, locally, approximately, a dilation. The picture below
shows this as a small interval in the domain(1 −∆x..1 +∆x) carried over to an
interval in the codomain(2 −∆y..2 +∆y) that is three times as wide.
x =1
y =2
In higher dimensions the core idea is the same but more can happen. For a
functiony : Rn→ Rm and a point⃗x∈ Rn, the derivative is deﬁned to be the
linear maph : Rn→ Rm that best approximates howy changes neary(⃗x). So
the geometry described above directly applies to the derivative.
We close by remarking how this point of view makes clear an often misun-
derstood result about derivatives, the Chain Rule. Recall that, under suitable
306 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
conditions on the two functions, the derivative of the composition is this.
d (g◦f)
dx (x) = dg
dx (f(x))· df
dx (x)
For instance the derivative of sin(x2 +3x) is cos(x2 +3x)· (2x +3).
Where does this come from? Considerf,g : R→ R.
x
f(x)
g(f(x))
The ﬁrst mapf dilates the neighborhood ofx by a factor of
df
dx (x)
and the second mapg follows that by dilating a neighborhood off(x) by a factor
of dg
dx (f(x) )
and when combined, the composition dilates by the product of the two. In
higher dimensions the map expressing how a function changes near a point is
a linear map, and is represented by a matrix. The Chain Rule multiplies the
matrices.

the result that under a linear map the image of a subspace is a subspace.
(c) Linear maps preserve other linear ideas. Show that linear maps preserve
“betweeness”: if the pointB is betweenA andC then the image ofB is between
the image ofA and the image ofC.
6 Use a picture like the one that appears in the discussion of the Chain Rule to

the function—locally, approximately—dilates space, and how its inverse dilates
space (assuming, of course, that it has an inverse)?

can be done with a composition of maps, each of which only swaps a single pair of
coordinates. Hint: you can use induction onn. (Remark: in the fourth chapter we
will show this and we will also show that the parity of the number of swaps used is
determined byp. That is, although a particular permutation could be expressed in
two diﬀerent ways with two diﬀerent numbers of swaps, either both ways use an
even number of swaps, or both use an odd number.)

Magic Squares
A Chinese legend tells the story of a ﬂood by the Lo river. People oﬀered
sacriﬁces to appease the river. Each time a turtle emerged, walked around the
sacriﬁce, and returned to the water. Fuh-Hi, the founder of Chinese civilization,
interpreted this to mean that the river was still cranky. Fortunately, a child
noticed that on its shell the turtle had the pattern on the left below, which is
today called Lo Shu (“river scroll”).

The dots make the matrix on the right where the rows, columns, and diagonals
add to15. Now that the people knew how much to sacriﬁce, the river’s anger
cooled.

same number, the matrix’smagic number.

[Wikipedia, Magic Square]. Finding how many normal magic squares there are of
each size is an unsolved problem; see [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences].
If we don’t require that the squares be normal then we can say much more.
Every1×1 square is magic, trivially. If the rows, columns, and diagonals of a
2×2 matrix (
a b
c d
)
add tos thena +b =s,c +d =s,a +c =s,b +d =s,a +d =s, andb +c =s.
Exercise 2 shows that this system has the unique solutiona =b =c =d =s/2.
So the set of2×2 magic squares is a one-dimensional subspace ofM2×2.
A sum of two same-sized magic squares is magic and a scalar multiple of a
magic square is magic so the set ofn×n magic squares Mn is a vector space,
a subspace ofMn×n. This Topic shows that forn >3 the dimension ofMn is
n2 −n. The setMn,0 ofn×n magic squares with magic number0 is another
subspace and we will verify the formula for its dimension also:n2 −2n −1 when
n >3.
We will ﬁrst prove thatdim Mn = dim Mn,0 +1. Deﬁne thetrace of a
matrix to be the sum down its upper-left to lower-right diagonalTr(M) =
m1,1 +··· +mn,n. Consider the restriction of the trace to the magic squares
Tr: Mn→ R. The null space N (Tr) is the set of magic squares with magic
number zero Mn,0. Observe that the trace is onto because for anyr in the
codomain R then×n matrix whose entries are allr/n is a magic square with
magic numberr. Theorem Two.II.2.14 says that for any linear map the dimension
310 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
of the domain equals the dimension of the range space plus the dimension of the
null space, the map’s rank plus its nullity. Here the domain isMn, the range
space is R and the null space isMn,0, so we have thatdim Mn =1 +dim Mn,0.
We will ﬁnish by ﬁnding the dimension of the vector spaceMn,0. Forn =1
the dimension is clearly0. Exercise 3 shows that dimMn,0 is also0 forn =2.
That leaves showing thatdim Mn,0 =n2 −2n −1 forn >3. The fact that
the squares in this vector space are magic gives us a linear system of restrictions,
and the fact that they have magic number zero makes this system homogeneous:
for instance consider the3×3 case. The restriction that the rows, columns, and
diagonals of 

a b c
d e f
g h i


add to zero gives this(2n +2)×n2 linear system.
a +b +c =0
d +e +f =0
g +h +i =0
a +d +g =0
b +e +h =0
c +f +i =0
a +e +i =0
c +e +g =0
We will ﬁnd the dimension of the space by ﬁnding the number of free variables
in the linear system.
The matrix of coeﬃcients for the particular cases ofn =3 andn =4 are
below, with the rows and columns numbered to help in reading the proof. With
respect to the standard basis, each represents a linear maph : Rn2
→ R2n+2.
The domain has dimensionn2 so if we show that the rank of the matrix is2n +1
then we will have what we want, that the dimension of the null spaceMn,0 is
n2 − (2n +1).

We want to show that the rank of the matrix of coeﬃcients, the number of
rows in a maximal linearly independent set, is2n +1. The ﬁrstn rows of the
matrix of coeﬃcients add to the same vector as the secondn rows, the vector of
all ones. So a maximal linearly independent must omit at least one row. We will
show that the set of all rows but the ﬁrst{⃗ρ2 ... ⃗ρ2n+2} is linearly independent.
So consider this linear relationship.
c2⃗ρ2 +··· +c2n⃗ρ2n +c2n+1⃗ρ2n+1 +c2n+2⃗ρ2n+2 = ⃗0 (∗)
Now it gets messy. Focus on the lower left of the tables. Observe that in the
ﬁnal two rows, in the ﬁrstn columns, is a subrow that is all zeros except that it
starts with a one in column1 and a subrow that is all zeros except that it ends
with a one in columnn.
First, with ⃗ρ1 omitted, both column1 and columnn contain only two ones.
Since the only rows in (∗) with nonzero column1 entries are rows⃗ρn+1 and
⃗ρ2n+1, which have ones, we must havec2n+1 = −cn+1. Likewise considering
then-th entries of the vectors in (∗) gives thatc2n+2 = −c2n.
Next consider the columns between those two—in then = 3 table this
includes only column2 while in then = 4 table it includes both columns2
and 3. Each such column has a single one. That is, for each column index
j∈ {2...n −2} the column consists of only zeros except for a one in rown +j,
and hencecn+j =0.
On to the next block of columns, fromn +1 through2n. Columnn +1 has
only two ones (becausen >3 the ones in the last two rows do not fall in the ﬁrst
column of this block). Thusc2 = −cn+1 and thereforec2 =c2n+1. Likewise,
from column2n we conclude thatc2 = −c2n and soc2 =c2n+2.
Because n > 3 there is at least one column between columnn +1 and
column2n −1. In at least one of those columns a one appears in⃗ρ2n+1. If a one
also appears in that column in⃗ρ2n+2 then we havec2 = −(c2n+1 +c2n+2) since
312 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
cn+j =0 forj∈ {2...n −2}. If a one does not appear in that column in⃗ρ2n+2
then we havec2 = −c2n+1. In either casec2 =0, and thusc2n+1 =c2n+2 =0
andcn+1 =c2n =0.
If the next block ofn-many columns is not the last then similarly conclude
from its ﬁrst column thatc3 =cn+1 =0.
Keep this up until we reach the last block of columns, those numbered
(n −1)n +1 throughn2. Becausecn+1 =··· =c2n =0 columnn2 gives that
cn = −c2n+1 =0.
Therefore the rank of the matrix is2n +1, as required.

Markov Chains
Here is a simple game: a player bets on coin tosses, a dollar each time, and the
game ends either when the player has no money or is up to ﬁve dollars. If the
player starts with three dollars, what is the chance that the game takes at least
ﬁve ﬂips? Twenty-ﬁve ﬂips?
At any point, this player has either $0, or $1, ..., or $5. We say that the
player is in thestate s0,s1, ..., or s5. In the game the player moves from state
to state. For instance, a player now in states3 has on the next ﬂip a0.5 chance
of moving to states2 and a0.5 chance of moving tos4. The boundary states
are diﬀerent; a player never leaves states0 or states5.
Letpi(n) be the probability that the player is in statesi aftern ﬂips. Then
for instance the probability of being in states0 after ﬂipn +1 isp0(n +1) =
p0(n) +0.5·p1(n). This equation summarizes.

and here we have used Real Double Float, and (2)Sage likes to do matrix
multiplication from the right, as⃗vM instead of our usualM⃗v, so we needed to

This game is not likely to go on for long since the player quickly moves to an
ending state. For instance, after the fourth ﬂip there is already a0.50 probability
that the game is over.
This is aMarkov chain. Each vector is aprobability vector, whose entries
are nonnegative real numbers that sum to1. The matrix is atransition matrix
or stochastic matrix, whose entries are nonnegative reals and whose columns
sum to1.
A characteristic feature of a Markov chain model is that it ishistoryless in
that the next state depends only on the current state, not on any prior ones.
Thus, a player who arrives ats2 by starting in states3 and then going to states2
has exactly the same chance of moving next tos3 as does a player whose history
was to start ins3 then go tos4 then tos3 and then tos2.
Here is a Markov chain from sociology. A study ([Macdonald & Ridge],
p. 202) divided occupations in the United Kingdom into three levels: executives
and professionals, supervisors and skilled manual workers, and unskilled workers.
They asked about two thousand men, “At what level are you, and at what level
was your father when you were fourteen years old?” Here the Markov model
assumption about history may seem reasonable—we may guess that while a
parent’s occupation has a direct inﬂuence on the occupation of the child, the
grandparent’s occupation likely has no such direct inﬂuence. This summarizes
the study’s conclusions.

One more example. In professional American baseball there are two leagues,
the American League and the National League. At the end of the annual season
the team winning the American League and the team winning the National
League play the World Series. The winner is the ﬁrst team to take four games.
That means that a series is in one of twenty-four states:0-0 (no games won
yet by either team),1-0 (one game won for the American League team and no
games for the National League team), etc.
Consider a series with a probabilityp that the American League team wins

An especially interesting special case is when the teams are evenly matched,

Note that evenly-matched teams are likely to have a long series—there is a

Markov chains are a widely used application of matrix operations. They
also give us an example of the use of matrices where we do not consider the
signiﬁcance of the maps represented by the matrices. For more on Markov chains,
there are many sources such as [Kemeny & Snell] and [Iosifescu].

with probability0.102 a large Electric and Electronic Equipment ﬁrm from the

or move to another category of ﬁrm. There is a0.021 probability that a ﬁrm in the

move in from abroad, into the Northeast. Finally, with probability0.954 a ﬁrm

4 [Wickens] Here is a model of some kinds of learning The learner starts in an
undecided statesU. Eventually the learner has to decide to do either responseA
(that is, end in statesA) or responseB (ending insB). However, the learner doesn’t
jump right from undecided to sure thatA is the correct thing to do (orB). Instead,
the learner spends some time in a “tentative-A” state, or a “tentative-B” state,
trying the response out (denoted heretA andtB). Imagine that once the learner has
decided, it is ﬁnal, so once insA orsB, the learner stays there. For the other state
changes, we can posit transitions with probabilityp in either direction.

Orthonormal Matrices
In The Elements, Euclid considers two ﬁgures to be the same if they have the
same size and shape. That is, while the triangles below are not equal because
they are not the same set of points, they are, for Euclid’s purposes, essentially
indistinguishable because we can imagine picking the plane up, sliding it over
and rotating it a bit, although not warping or stretching it, and then putting it
back down, to superimpose the ﬁrst ﬁgure on the second. (Euclid never explicitly
states this principle but he uses it often [Casey].)

P3
Q1
Q2
Q3
In modern terms “picking the plane up ...” is taking a map from the plane to
itself. Euclid considers only transformations that may slide or turn the plane but
not bend or stretch it. Accordingly, deﬁne a mapf : R2→ R2 to bedistance-
preserving or arigid motion or anisometry if for all pointsP1,P2∈ R2, the
distance fromf(P1) tof(P2) equals the distance fromP1 toP2. We also deﬁne a
plane ﬁgureto be a set of points in the plane and we say that two ﬁgures are
congruent if there is a distance-preserving map from the plane to itself that
carries one ﬁgure onto the other.
Many statements from Euclidean geometry follow easily from these deﬁnitions.
Some are: (i) collinearity is invariant under any distance-preserving map (that is,
ifP1,P2, andP3 are collinear then so aref(P1),f(P2), andf(P3)), (ii) betweeness
is invariant under any distance-preserving map (ifP2 is betweenP1 andP3 then
so isf(P2) betweenf(P1) and f(P3)), (iii) the property of being a triangle is
invariant under any distance-preserving map (if a ﬁgure is a triangle then the
image of that ﬁgure is also a triangle), (iv) and the property of being a circle is
invariant under any distance-preserving map. In 1872, F. Klein suggested that
we can deﬁne Euclidean geometry as the study of properties that are invariant
320 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
under these maps. (This forms part of Klein’s Erlanger Program, which proposes
the organizing principle that we can describe each kind of geometry—Euclidean,
projective, etc.—as the study of the properties that are invariant under some
group of transformations. The word ‘group’ here means more than just ‘collection’
but that lies outside of our scope.)
We can use linear algebra to characterize the distance-preserving maps of
the plane.
To begin, observe that there are distance-preserving transformations of the
plane that are not linear. The obvious example is thistranslation.
(
x
y
)
↦→
(
x
y
)
+
(

0
)
=
(
x +1
y
)
However, this example turns out to be the only one, in that iff is distance-
preserving and sends⃗0 to ⃗v0 then the map⃗v↦→f(⃗v) − ⃗v0 is linear. That will
follow immediately from this statement: a mapt that is distance-preserving
and sends⃗0 to itself is linear. To prove this equivalent statement, consider the
standard basis and suppose that
t(⃗e1) =
(
a
b
)
t(⃗e2) =
(
c
d
)
for somea,b,c,d ∈ R. To show thatt is linear we can show that it can be
represented by a matrix, that is, thatt acts in this way for allx,y∈ R.
⃗v =
(
x
y
)
t
↦−→
(
ax +cy
bx +dy
)
(∗)
Recall that if we ﬁx three non-collinear points then we can determine any point
by giving its distance from those three. So we can determine any point⃗v in the
domain by its distance from⃗0, ⃗e1, and⃗e2. Similarly, we can determine any point
t(⃗v) in the codomain by its distance from the three ﬁxed pointst(⃗0),t(⃗e1), and
t(⃗e2) (these three are not collinear because, as mentioned above, collinearity is
invariant and⃗0, ⃗e1, and ⃗e2 are not collinear). Becauset is distance-preserving
we can say more: for the point⃗v in the plane that is determined by being the
distanced0 from ⃗0, the distanced1 from ⃗e1, and the distanced2 from ⃗e2, its
image t(⃗v) must be the unique point in the codomain that is determined by
beingd0 fromt(⃗0),d1 fromt(⃗e1), andd2 fromt(⃗e2). Because of the uniqueness,
checking that the action in (∗) works in thed0,d1, andd2 cases
dist(
(
x
y
)
,⃗0) = dist(t(
(
x
y
)
),t (⃗0)) = dist(
(
ax +cy
bx +dy
)
,⃗0)
Topic: Orthonormal Matrices 321
(we assumed thatt maps ⃗0 to itself)
dist(
(
x
y
)
, ⃗e1) = dist(t(
(
x
y
)
),t (⃗e1)) = dist(
(
ax +cy

,
(

)
)
and
dist(
(

)
, ⃗e2) = dist(t(
(
x

)
),t (⃗e2)) = dist(
(
ax +cy
bx +dy
)
,
(
c
d
)
)
suﬃces to show that (∗) describest. Those checks are routine.
Thus any distance-preservingf : R2→ R2 is a linear map plus a translation,
f(⃗v) =t(⃗v) + ⃗v0 for some constant vector⃗v0 and linear mapt that is distance-
preserving. So in order to understand distance-preserving maps what remains is
to understand distance-preserving linear maps.
Not every linear map is distance-preserving. For example⃗v↦→2⃗v does not
preserve distances.
But there is a neat characterization: a linear transformationt of the plane
is distance-preserving if and only if both‖t(⃗e1)‖ =‖t(⃗e2)‖ =1, andt(⃗e1) is
orthogonal tot(⃗e2). The ‘only if’ half of that statement is easy—becauset
is distance-preserving it must preserve the lengths of vectors and becauset
is distance-preserving the Pythagorean theorem shows that it must preserve
orthogonality. To show the ‘if’ half we can check that the map preserves lengths
of vectors because then for all⃗p and ⃗q the distance between the two is preserved
‖t(⃗p − ⃗q )‖ =‖t(⃗p) −t(⃗q )‖ =‖⃗p − ⃗q‖. For that check let
⃗v =
(
x
y
)
t(⃗e1) =
(
a
b
)
t(⃗e2) =
(
c
d
)
and with the ‘if’ assumptions thata2 +b2 =c2 +d2 =1 andac +bd =0 we
have this.
‖t(⃗v )‖2 = (ax +cy)2 + (bx +dy)2
=a2x2 +2acxy +c2y2 +b2x2 +2bdxy +d2y2
=x2(a2 +b2) +y2(c2 +d2) +2xy(ac +bd)
=x2 +y2
=‖⃗v‖2
One thing that is neat about this characterization is that we can easily
recognize matrices that represent such a map with respect to the standard
bases: the columns are of length one and are mutually orthogonal. This is an
orthonormal matrix (or, more informally,orthogonal matrix since people
322 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
often use this term to mean not just that the columns are orthogonal but also
that they have length one).
We can leverage this characterization to understand the geometric actions
of distance-preserving maps. Because‖t(⃗v )‖ =‖⃗v‖, the mapt sends any ⃗v
somewhere on the circle about the origin that has radius equal to the length of
⃗v. In particular,⃗e1 and ⃗e2 map to the unit circle. What’s more, once we ﬁx the
unit vector ⃗e1 as mapped to the vector with componentsa andb then there
are only two places where⃗e2 can go if its image is to be perpendicular to the
ﬁrst vector’s image: it can map either to one where⃗e2 maintains its position a
quarter circle clockwise from⃗e1

or to one where it goes a quarter circle counterclockwise.
(a

)
( b
−a
)
RepE2,E2 (t) =
(
a b
b −a
)
The geometric description of these two cases is easy. Letθ be the counter-
clockwise angle between thex-axis and the image of⃗e1. The ﬁrst matrix above
represents, with respect to the standard bases, arotation of the plane byθ
radians.

(This picture shows⃗e1 reﬂected up into the ﬁrst quadrant and⃗e2 reﬂected down
into the fourth quadrant.)
Note: in the domain the angle between⃗e1 and ⃗e2 runs counterclockwise, and
in the ﬁrst map above the angle fromt(⃗e1) tot(⃗e2) is also counterclockwise,
so it preserves the orientation of the angle. But the second map reverses the
orientation. A distance-preserving map isdirect if it preserves orientations and
opposite if it reverses orientation.
With that, we have characterized the Euclidean study of congruence. It
considers, for plane ﬁgures, the properties that are invariant under combinations
of (i) a rotation followed by a translation, or (ii) a reﬂection followed by a
translation (a reﬂection followed by a non-trivial translation is aglide reﬂection).
Another idea encountered in elementary geometry, besides congruence of
ﬁgures, is that ﬁgures aresimilar if they are congruent after a change of scale.
The two triangles below are similar since the second is the same shape as the
ﬁrst but3/2-ths the size.

From the above work we have that ﬁgures are similar if there is an orthonormal
matrixT such that the points⃗q on one ﬁgure are the images of the points⃗p on
the other ﬁgure by⃗q = (kT )⃗v + ⃗p0 for some nonzero real numberk and constant
vector ⃗p0.
Although these ideas are from Euclid, mathematics is timeless and they are
still in use today. One application of the maps studied above is in computer
graphics. We can, for example, animate this top view of a cube by putting
together ﬁlm frames of it rotating; that’s a rigid motion.
Frame 1 Frame 2 Frame 3
324 Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces
We could also make the cube appear to be moving away from us by producing
ﬁlm frames of it shrinking, which gives us ﬁgures that are similar.
Frame 1: Frame 2: Frame 3:
Computer graphics incorporates techniques from linear algebra in many other
ways (see Exercise 4).
A beautiful book that explores some of this area is [Weyl]. More on groups,
of transformations and otherwise, is in any book on Modern Algebra, for instance
[Birkhoﬀ & MacLane]. More on Klein and the Erlanger Program is in [Yaglom].

Chapter Four
Determinants
In the ﬁrst chapter we highlighted the special case of linear systems with the
same number of equations as unknowns, those of the formT⃗x = ⃗b whereT is a
square matrix. We noted that there are only two kinds ofT’s. IfT is associated
with a unique solution for any⃗b, such as for the homogeneous systemT⃗x = ⃗0,
thenT is associated with a unique solution for every such⃗b. We call such a
matrix nonsingular. The other kind ofT, where every linear system for which it
is the matrix of coeﬃcients has either no solution or inﬁnitely many solutions,
we call singular.
In our work since then this distinction has been a theme. For instance, we
now know that ann×n matrixT is nonsingular if and only if each of these holds:
• any systemT⃗x = ⃗b has a solution and that solution is unique;
• Gauss-Jordan reduction ofT yields an identity matrix;
• the rows ofT form a linearly independent set;
• the columns ofT form a linearly independent set, a basis forRn;
• any map thatT represents is an isomorphism;
• an inverse matrixT −1 exists.
So when we look at a square matrix, one of the ﬁrst things that we ask is whether
it is nonsingular.
This chapter develops a formula that determines whetherT is nonsingular.
More precisely, we will develop a formula for1×1 matrices, one for2×2 matrices,
etc. These are naturally related; that is, we will develop a family of formulas, a
scheme that describes the formula for each size.
Since we will restrict the discussion to square matrices, in this chapter we
will often simply say ‘matrix’ in place of ‘square matrix’.

n the formula deﬁnes adeterminant function detn×n : Mn×n→ R such that an
n×n matrixT is nonsingular if and only ifdetn×n(T )⁄=0. (We usually omit
the subscriptn×n because the size ofT describes which determinant function
we mean.)
I.1 Exploration
This subsection is an optional motivation and development of the general
deﬁnition. The deﬁnition is in the next subsection.
Above, in each case the matrix is nonsingular if and only if some formula is
nonzero. But the three formulas don’t show an obvious pattern. We may spot
that the1×1 terma has one letter, that the2×2 termsad andbc have two
letters, and that the3×3 terms each have three letters. We may even spot that
in those terms there is a letter from each row and column of the matrix, e.g., in
thecdh term one letter comes from each row and from each column.


c
d
h


But these observations are perhaps more puzzling than enlightening. For instance,
we might wonder why some terms are added but some are subtracted.
Section I. Definition 327
A good strategy for solving problems is to explore which properties the
solution must have, and then search for something with those properties. So we
shall start by asking what properties we’d like the determinant formulas to have.
At this point, our main way to decide whether a matrix is singular or not is
to do Gaussian reduction and then check whether the diagonal of the echelon
form matrix has any zeroes, that is, whether the product down the diagonal
is zero. So we could guess that whatever determinant formula we ﬁnd, the proof
that it is right may involve applying Gauss’s Method to the matrix to show that
in the end the product down the diagonal is zero if and only if our formula gives
zero.
This suggests a plan: we will look for a family of determinant formulas that
are unaﬀected by row operations and such that the determinant of an echelon
form matrix is the product of its diagonal entries. In the rest of this subsection
we will test this plan against the2×2 and3×3 formulas. In the end we will
have to modify the “unaﬀected by row operations” part, but not by much.
First we check whether the2×2 and3×3 formulas are unaﬀected by the row
operation of combining: if
T
kρi+ρj
−→ ˆT
then isdet(ˆT ) = det(T )? This check of the2×2 determinant after thekρ1 +ρ2
operation
det(
(
a b
ka +c kb +d
)
) =a(kb +d) − (ka +c)b =ad −bc
shows that it is indeed unchanged, and the other2×2 combinationkρ2 +ρ1 gives
the same result. Likewise, the3×3 combinationkρ3 +ρ2 leaves the determinant
unchanged
det(


a b c
kg +d kh +e ki +f
g h i

) =a(kh +e)i +b(ki +f)g +c(kg +d)h
−h(ki +f)a −i(kg +d)b −g(kh +e)c
=aei +bfg +cdh −hfa −idb −gec
as do the other3×3 row combination operations.
So there seems to be promise in the plan. Of course, perhaps if we had
worked out the4×4 determinant formula and tested it then we might have found
that it is aﬀected by row combinations. This is an exploration and we do not
yet have all the facts. Nonetheless, so far, so good.
Next we comparedet(ˆT ) with det(T ) for row swaps. Here we hit a snag: the
328 Chapter Four. Determinants
2×2 row swapρ1↔ρ2 does not yieldad −bc.
det(
(
c d
a b
)
) =bc −ad
And thisρ1↔ρ3 swap inside of a3×3 matrix
det(


g h i
d e f
a b c

) =gec +hfa +idb −bfg −cdh −aei
also does not give the same determinant as before the swap since again there is
a sign change. Trying a diﬀerent3×3 swapρ1↔ρ2
det(


d e f
a b c
g h i

) =dbi +ecg +fah −hcd −iae −gbf
also gives a change of sign.
So row swaps appear in this experiment to change the sign of a determinant.
This does not wreck our plan entirely. We hope to decide nonsingularity by
considering only whether the formula gives zero, not by considering its sign.
Therefore, instead of expecting determinant formulas to be entirely unaﬀected
by row operations we modify our plan so that on a swap they will change sign.
Obviously we ﬁnish by comparingdet(ˆT ) with det(T ) for the operation of
multiplying a row by a scalar. This
det(
(
a b
kc kd
)
) =a(kd) − (kc)b =k· (ad −bc)
ends with the entire determinant multiplied byk, and the other2×2 case has
the same result. This3×3 case ends the same way
det(


a b c
d e f
kg kh ki

) =ae(ki) +bf(kg) +cd(kh)
−(kh)fa − (ki)db − (kg)ec
=k· (aei +bfg +cdh −hfa −idb −gec)
as do the other two3×3 cases. These make us suspect that multiplying a row
byk multiplies the determinant byk. As before, this modiﬁes our plan but does
not wreck it. We are asking only that the zero-ness of the determinant formula
be unchanged, not focusing on the its sign or magnitude.
So in this exploration our plan got modiﬁed in some inessential ways and is
now: we will look forn×n determinant functions that remain unchanged under
Section I. Definition 329
the operation of row combination, that change sign on a row swap, that rescale
on the rescaling of a row, and such that the determinant of an echelon form
matrix is the product down the diagonal. In the next two subsections we will
see that for eachn there is one and only one such function.
Finally, for the next subsection note that factoring out scalars is a row-wise
operation: here
det(


3 3 9
2 1 1
5 11 −5

) =3·det(


1 1 3
2 1 1
5 11 −5

)
the3 comes only out of the top row only, leaving the other rows unchanged.
Consequently in the deﬁnition of determinant we will write it as a function of
the rowsdet(⃗ρ1, ⃗ρ2,... ⃗ρn), rather than asdet(T ) or as a function of the entries
det(t1,1,...,t n,n).

I.2 Properties of Determinants
We want a formula to determine whether ann×n matrix is nonsingular. We will
not begin by stating such a formula. Instead we will begin by considering, for
332 Chapter Four. Determinants
eachn, the function that such a formula calculates. We will deﬁne this function
by a list of properties. We will then prove that a function with these properties
exists and is unique, and also describe how to compute it. (Because we will
eventually prove this, from the start we will just say ‘det(T )’ instead of ‘if there
is a unique determinant function then det(T )’.)
2.1 DeﬁnitionAn×n determinant is a function det: Mn×n→ R such that
(1) det(⃗ρ1,...,k · ⃗ρi + ⃗ρj,..., ⃗ρn) = det(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗ρj,..., ⃗ρn) fori⁄=j
(2) det(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗ρj,..., ⃗ρi,..., ⃗ρn) = − det(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗ρi,..., ⃗ρj,..., ⃗ρn) fori⁄=j
(3) det(⃗ρ1,...,k ⃗ρi,..., ⃗ρn) =k·det(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗ρi,..., ⃗ρn) for any scalark
(4) det(I) =1 whereI is an identity matrix
(the ⃗ρ’s are the rows of the matrix). We often write|T | for det(T ).
2.2 Remark Condition (2) is redundant since
T
ρi+ρj
−→
−ρj+ρi
−→
ρi+ρj
−→
−ρi
−→ ˆT
swaps rowsi andj. We have listed it for consistency with the Gauss’s Method
presentation in earlier chapters.
2.3 Remark Condition (3) does not have ak⁄=0 restriction, although the Gauss’s
Method operation of multiplying a row byk does have it. The next result shows
that we do not need that restriction here.
2.4 Lemma A matrix with two identical rows has a determinant of zero. A matrix
with a zero row has a determinant of zero. A matrix is nonsingular if and only
if its determinant is nonzero. The determinant of an echelon form matrix is the
product down its diagonal.
Proof To verify the ﬁrst sentence swap the two equal rows. The sign of the
determinant changes but the matrix is the same and so its determinant is the
same. Thus the determinant is zero.
For the second sentence multiply the zero row by two. That doubles the de-
terminant but it also leaves the row unchanged, and hence leaves the determinant
unchanged. Thus the determinant must be zero.
Do Gauss-Jordan reduction for the third sentence,T→···→ ˆT. By the ﬁrst
three properties the determinant ofT is zero if and only if the determinant ofˆT is
zero (although the two could diﬀer in sign or magnitude). A nonsingular matrix
T Gauss-Jordan reduces to an identity matrix and so has a nonzero determinant.
Section I. Definition 333
A singularT reduces to aˆT with a zero row; by the second sentence of this
lemma its determinant is zero.
The fourth sentence has two cases. If the echelon form matrix is singular
then it has a zero row. Thus it has a zero on its diagonal and the product down
its diagonal is zero. By the third sentence of this result the determinant is zero
and therefore this matrix’s determinant equals the product down its diagonal.
If the echelon form matrix is nonsingular then none of its diagonal entries is
zero. This means that we can divide by those entries and use condition (3) to
get1’s on the diagonal.

So in this case also, the determinant is the product down the diagonal.QED
That gives us a way to compute the value of a determinant function on a
matrix: do Gaussian reduction, keeping track of any changes of sign caused by
row swaps and any scalars that we factor out, and ﬁnish by multiplying down
the diagonal of the echelon form result. This algorithm is as fast as Gauss’s
Method and so is practical on all of the matrices that we will see.

That example raises an important point. This chapter’s introduction gives
formulas for2×2 and3×3 determinants, so we know that they exist, but not for
determinant functions on matrices that are4×4 or larger. Instead, Deﬁnition 2.1
gives properties that a determinant function should have and leads to computing
determinants by Gauss’s Method.
However, for any matrix we can reduce it to echelon form by Gauss’s Method
in multiple ways. For example, given a reduction we could change it by inserting
a ﬁrst step that multiplies the top row by2 and then a second step that multiplies
it by1/2. So we have to worry that two diﬀerent Gauss’s Method reductions
could lead to two diﬀerent computed values for the determinant.
That is, we must verify that Deﬁnition 2.1 gives a well-deﬁned function. The
next two subsections do this, showing that there exists a well-deﬁned function
satisfying the deﬁnition.
But ﬁrst we show that if there is such a function then there is no more than
one. The example above illustrates the idea: we got5 by following the properties
of the deﬁnition. So while we have not yet proved thatdet4×4 exists, that there
is a function with properties (1)–(4), if such a function satisfying them does
exist then we know what value it gives on the above matrix.
2.7 Lemma For eachn, if there is ann×n determinant function then it is unique.
Proof Suppose that there are two functionsdet1,det2 : Mn×n→ R satisfying
the properties of Deﬁnition 2.1 and its consequence Lemma 2.4. Given a square
matrix M, ﬁx some way of performing Gauss’s Method to bring the matrix
to echelon form (it does not matter that there are multiple ways, just ﬁx one
of them). By using this ﬁxed reduction as in the above examples—keeping
track of row-scaling factors and how the sign alternates on row swaps, and then
multiplying down the diagonal of the echelon form result—we can compute the
value that these two functions must return onM, and they must return the
same value. Since they give the same output on every input, they are the same
function. QED
The ‘if there is ann×n determinant function’ emphasizes that, although we
can use Gauss’s Method to compute the only value that a determinant function
Section I. Definition 335
could possibly return, we haven’t yet shown that such a function exists for alln.
The rest of this section does that.

I.3 The Permutation Expansion
The prior subsection deﬁnes a function to be a determinant if it satisﬁes four
conditions and shows that there is at most onen×n determinant function for
eachn. What is left is to show that for eachn such a function exists.
But, we easily compute determinants: we use Gauss’s Method, keeping track
of the sign changes from row swaps, and end by multiplying down the diagonal.
How could they not exist?
The diﬃculty is to show that the computation gives a well-deﬁned—that
is, unique—result. Consider these two Gauss’s Method reductions of the same
matrix, the ﬁrst without any row swap
(
1 2
3 4

−3ρ1+ρ2

and the second with one.

−→
(
3 4
1 2
)
−(1/3)ρ1+ρ2
−→
(
3 4
0 2/3
)
Both yield the determinant−2 since in the second one we note that the row
swap changes the sign of the result we get by multiplying down the diagonal.
The fact that we are able to proceed in two ways opens the possibility that the
two give diﬀerent answers. That is, the way that we have given to compute
determinant values does not plainly eliminate the possibility that there might be,
say, two reductions of some7×7 matrix that lead to diﬀerent determinant values.
In that case we would not have a function, since the deﬁnition of a function is
that for each input there must be exactly associated one output. The rest of
this section shows that the deﬁnition Deﬁnition 2.1 never leads to a conﬂict.
To do this we will deﬁne an alternative way to ﬁnd the value of a determinant.
(This alternative is less useful in practice because it is slow. But it is very useful
for theory.) The key idea is that condition (3) of Deﬁnition 2.1 shows that the
determinant function is not linear.

not from the entire matrix at once. So, where
A =
(
2 1
−1 3
)
then det(2A)⁄=2·det(A) (instead, det(2A) =4·det(A)).
338 Chapter Four. Determinants
Since scalars come out a row at a time we might guess that determinants are
linear a row at a time.
3.2 DeﬁnitionLetV be a vector space. A mapf :Vn→ R is multilinear if
(1) f(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗v + ⃗w,..., ⃗ρn) =f(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗v,..., ⃗ρn) +f(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗w,..., ⃗ρn)
(2) f(⃗ρ1,...,k ⃗v,..., ⃗ρn) =k·f(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗v,..., ⃗ρn)
for ⃗v, ⃗w∈V andk∈ R.
3.3 Lemma Determinants are multilinear.
Proof Property (2) here is just Deﬁnition 2.1’s condition (3) so we need only
verify property (1).
There are two cases. If the set of other rows{⃗ρ1,..., ⃗ρi−1, ⃗ρi+1,..., ⃗ρn }
is linearly dependent then all three matrices are singular and so all three
determinants are zero and the equality is trivial.
Therefore assume that the set of other rows is linearly independent. We can
make a basis by adding one more vector⟨⃗ρ1,..., ⃗ρi−1, ⃗β, ⃗ρi+1,..., ⃗ρn⟩. Express
⃗v and ⃗w with respect to this basis
⃗v =v1⃗ρ1 +··· +vi−1⃗ρi−1 +vi⃗β +vi+1⃗ρi+1 +··· +vn⃗ρn
⃗w =w1⃗ρ1 +··· +wi−1⃗ρi−1 +wi⃗β +wi+1⃗ρi+1 +··· +wn⃗ρn
and add.
⃗v + ⃗w = (v1 +w1)⃗ρ1 +··· + (vi +wi)⃗β +··· + (vn +wn)⃗ρn
Consider the left side of (1) and expand⃗v + ⃗w.
det(⃗ρ1,..., (v1 +w1)⃗ρ1 +··· + (vi +wi)⃗β +··· + (vn +wn)⃗ρn,..., ⃗ρn) (∗)
By the deﬁnition of determinant’s condition (1), the value of (∗) is unchanged
by the operation of adding−(v1 +w1)⃗ρ1 to thei-th row⃗v + ⃗w. Thei-th row
becomes this.
⃗v + ⃗w − (v1 +w1)⃗ρ1 = (v2 +w2)⃗ρ2 +··· + (vi +wi)⃗β +··· + (vn +wn)⃗ρn
Next add −(v2 +w2)⃗ρ2, etc., to eliminate all of the terms from the other rows.
Apply condition (3) from the deﬁnition of determinant.
det(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗v + ⃗w,..., ⃗ρn)
= det(⃗ρ1,..., (vi +wi)· ⃗β,..., ⃗ρn)
= (vi +wi)·det(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗β,..., ⃗ρn)
=vi·det(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗β,..., ⃗ρn) +wi·det(⃗ρ1,..., ⃗β,..., ⃗ρn)
Section I. Definition 339
Now this is a sum of two determinants. To ﬁnish, bringvi andwi back inside
in front of the⃗β’s and use row combinations again, this time to reconstruct the
expressions of⃗v and ⃗w in terms of the basis. That is, start with the operations
of addingv1⃗ρ1 tovi⃗β andw1⃗ρ1 towi⃗ρ1, etc., to get the expansions of⃗v and ⃗w.

Multilinearity allows us to expand a determinant into a sum of determinants,
each of which involves a simple matrix.

The result is four determinants. In each row of each of the four there is a single
entry from the original matrix.
3.5 Example In the same way, a3×3 determinant separates into a sum of many
simpler determinants. Splitting along the ﬁrst row produces three determinants
(we have highlighted the zero in the1,3 position to set it oﬀ visually from the
zeroes that appear as part of the splitting).

In turn, each of the above splits in three along the second row. Then each of the
nine splits in three along the third row. The result is twenty seven determinants,
such that each row contains a single entry from the starting matrix.

So multilinearity will expand ann×n determinant into a sum ofnn-many
determinants, where each row of each determinant contains a single entry from
the starting matrix.
In this expansion, although there are lots of terms, most of them have a
determinant of zero.

For instance, in the ﬁrst matrix the2 and the4 both come from the ﬁrst column
of the original matrix. In the second matrix the−1 and5 both come from the
third column. And in the third matrix the0 and5 both come from the third
column. Any such matrix is singular because one row is a multiple of the other.
Thus any such determinant is zero, by Lemma 2.4.
With that observation the above expansion of the3×3 determinant into the
sum of the twenty seven determinants simpliﬁes to the sum of these six where
the entries from the original matrix come one per row, and also one per column.

That example captures this subsection’s new calculation scheme. Multi-
linearity expands a determinant into many separate determinants, each with
one entry from the original matrix per row. Most of these have one row that
is a multiple of another so we omit them. We are left with the determinants
that have one entry per row and column from the original matrix. Factoring
out the scalars further reduces the determinants that we must compute to the
one-entry-per-row-and-column matrices where all entries are1’s.
Recall Deﬁnition Three.IV.3.14, that apermutation matrix is square, with
entries0’s except for a single1 in each row and column. We now introduce a
notation for permutation matrices.
3.7 DeﬁnitionAnn-permutation is a function on the ﬁrstn positive integers
φ : {1,...,n }→ {1,...,n } that is one-to-one and onto.
In a permutation each number1, ..., nappears as output for one and only one
input. We can denote a permutation as a sequenceφ =⟨φ(1),φ (2),...,φ (n)⟩.
3.8 Example The2-permutations are the functionsφ1 : {1,2 }→ {1,2 } given by
φ1(1) = 1, φ1(2) = 2, andφ2 : {1,2 }→ {1,2 } given byφ2(1) = 2, φ2(2) = 1.
The sequence notation is shorter:φ1 =⟨1,2⟩ andφ2 =⟨2,1⟩.
3.9 Example In the sequence notation the3-permutations areφ1 =⟨1,2,3⟩,
φ2 =⟨1,3,2⟩,φ3 =⟨2,1,3⟩,φ4 =⟨2,3,1⟩,φ5 =⟨3,1,2⟩, andφ6 =⟨3,2,1⟩.
We denote the row vector that is all0’s except for a1 in entryj withιj so
that the four-wideι2 is (0 1 0 0). Now our notation for permutation matrices
is: with anyφ =⟨φ(1),...,φ (n)⟩ associate the matrix whose rows areιφ(1),
..., ιφ(n). For instance, associated with the4-permutationφ =⟨3,2,1,4 ⟩ is the
matrix whose rows are the correspondingι’s.

Section I. Definition 343
Computing a determinant with the permutation expansion typically takes
longer than with Gauss’s Method. However, we will use it to prove that the
determinant function exists. The proof is long so we will just state the result
here and defer the proof to the following subsection.
3.14 Theorem For eachn there is ann×n determinant function.
Also in the next subsection is the proof of the next result (they are together
because the two proofs overlap).
3.15 Theorem The determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its trans-
pose.
Because of this theorem, while we have so far stated determinant results in
terms of rows, all of the results also hold in terms of columns.
3.16 Corollary A matrix with two equal columns is singular. Column swaps
change the sign of a determinant. Determinants are multilinear in their columns.
Proof For the ﬁrst statement, transposing the matrix results in a matrix with
the same determinant, and with two equal rows, and hence a determinant of
zero. Prove the other two in the same way. QED
We ﬁnish this subsection with a summary: determinant functions exist, are
unique, and we know how to compute them. As for what determinants are
about, perhaps these lines [Kemp] help make it memorable.

Solution: lots or none.

This reduces the problem of showing that the determinant is well-deﬁned to only
showing that the determinant is well-deﬁned on the set of permutation matrices.
A permutation matrix can be row-swapped to the identity matrix. So one
way that we can calculate its determinant is by keeping track of the number of
swaps. However, we still must show that the result is well-deﬁned. Recall what
the diﬃculty is: the determinant of
Pφ =

0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1



Both reductions have an odd number of swaps so in this case we ﬁgure that
|Pφ| = −1 but if there were some way to do it with an even number of swaps then
we would have the determinant giving two diﬀerent outputs from a single input.
Below, Corollary 4.5 proves that this cannot happen—there is no permutation
matrix that can be row-swapped to an identity matrix in two ways, one with an
even number of swaps and the other with an odd number of swaps.
4.1 DeﬁnitionIn a permutationφ =⟨...,k,...,j,... ⟩, elements such thatk>j
are in aninversion of their natural order. Similarly, in a permutation matrix
two rows
Pφ =


...
ιk
...
ιj
...


such thatk>j are in aninversion.
4.2 Example This permutation matrix




 =





has a single inversion, thatι3 precedesι2.
4.3 Example There are three inversions here:


0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

 =


ι3
ι2
ι1


348 Chapter Four. Determinants
ι3 precedesι1,ι3 precedesι2, andι2 precedesι1.
4.4 Lemma A row-swap in a permutation matrix changes the number of inversions
from even to odd, or from odd to even.
Proof Consider a swap of rowsj andk, wherek>j .
If the two rows are adjacent
Pφ =


...
ιφ(j)
ιφ(k)
...


ρk↔ρj
−→


...
ιφ(k)
ιφ(j)
...


then since inversions involving rows not in this pair are not aﬀected, the swap
changes the total number of inversions by one, either removing or producing one
inversion depending on whetherφ(j)>φ (k) or not. Consequently, the total
number of inversions changes from odd to even or from even to odd.
If the rows are not adjacent then we can swap them via a sequence of adjacent
swaps, ﬁrst bringing rowk up


...
ιφ(j)
ιφ(j+1)
ιφ(j+2)
...
ιφ(k)
...



−→
ρk−1↔ρk−2
−→ ···
ρj+1↔ρj
−→


...
ιφ(k)
ιφ(j)
ιφ(j+1)
...
ιφ(k−1)
...


and then bringing rowj down.
ρj+1↔ρj+2
−→
ρj+2↔ρj+3
−→ ···
ρk−1↔ρk
−→


...
ιφ(k)
ιφ(j+1)
ιφ(j+2)
...
ιφ(j)
...


Each of these adjacent swaps changes the number of inversions from odd to even
or from even to odd. The total number of swaps(k −j) + (k −j −1) is odd.
Section I. Definition 349
Thus, in aggregate, the number of inversions changes from even to odd, or from
odd to even. QED
4.5 Corollary If a permutation matrix has an odd number of inversions then
swapping it to the identity takes an odd number of swaps. If it has an even
number of inversions then swapping to the identity takes an even number.
Proof The identity matrix has zero inversions. To change an odd number to
zero requires an odd number of swaps, and to change an even number to zero
requires an even number of swaps. QED
4.6 Example The matrix in Example 4.3 can be brought to the identity with one
swapρ1↔ρ3. (So the number of swaps needn’t be the same as the number of
inversions, but the oddness or evenness of the two numbers is the same.)
4.7 Deﬁnition The signum of a permutation sgn(φ) is −1 if the number of
inversions inφ is odd and is+1 if the number of inversions is even.
4.8 Example Using the notation for the3-permutations from Example 3.8 we
have
Pφ1 =


1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

 Pφ2 =


1 0 0
0 0 1
0 1 0


so sgn(φ1) = 1 because there are no inversions, whilesgn(φ2) = −1 because
there is one.
We still have not shown that the determinant function is well-deﬁned because
we have not considered row operations on permutation matrices other than row
swaps. We will ﬁnesse this issue. Deﬁne a functiond : Mn×n→ R by altering
the permutation expansion formula, replacing|Pφ| with sgn(φ).
d(T ) =
∑
permutationsφ
t1,φ(1)t2,φ(2)··· tn,φ(n)·sgn(φ)
The advantage of this formula is that the number of inversions is clearly well-
deﬁned—just count them. Therefore, we will be ﬁnished showing that ann×n
determinant function exists when we show thatd satisﬁes the conditions in the
deﬁnition of a determinant.
4.9 Lemma The functiond above is a determinant. Hence determinant functions
detn×n exist for everyn.
350 Chapter Four. Determinants
Proof We must check that it satisﬁes the four conditions from the deﬁnition of
determinant, Deﬁnition 2.1.
Condition (4) is easy: whereI is then×n identity, in
d(I) =
∑
permφ
ι1,φ(1)ι2,φ(2)··· ιn,φ(n)sgn(φ)
all of the terms in the summation are zero except for the one where the permu-
tationφ is the identity, which gives the product down the diagonal, which is
one.

ofd(T ).
d(ˆT ) =

We will show that each term in (∗) is associated with a term ind(T ), and that the
two terms are negatives of each other. Consider the matrix from the multilinear
expansion ofd(ˆT ) giving the termˆt1,φ(1)··· ˆti,φ(i)··· ˆtj,φ(j)··· ˆtn,φ(n)sgn(φ).

Section I. Definition 351
That is, the term with hattedt’s is associated with this term from thed(T )
expansion: t1,σ(1)··· tj,σ(j)··· ti,σ(i)··· tn,σ(n)sgn(σ), where the permutation
σ equalsφ but with thei-th andj-th numbers interchanged,σ(i) = φ(j) and
σ(j) = φ(i). The two terms have the same multiplicandsˆt1,φ(1) = t1,σ(1),
..., including the entries from the swapped rowsˆti,φ(i) =tj,φ(i) =tj,σ(j) and
ˆtj,φ(j) =ti,φ(j) =ti,σ(i). But the two terms are negatives of each other since
sgn(φ) = − sgn(σ) by Lemma 4.4.
Now, any permutationφ can be derived from some other permutationσ by
such a swap, in one and only one way. Therefore the summation in (∗) is in fact
a sum over all permutations, taken once and only once.
d(ˆT ) =

can see thatd(S) = 0: a swap ofS’s equal rows will change the sign ofd(S)
but since the matrix is unchanged by that swap the value ofd(S) must also be
unchanged, and so that value must be zero. QED
We have now proved that determinant functions exist for each sizen×n. We
already know that for each size there is at most one determinant. Therefore, for
each size there is one and only one determinant function.
We end this subsection by proving the other result remaining from the prior
subsection.
4.10 Theorem The determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its trans-
pose.
Proof The proof is best understood by doing the general3×3 case. That the
argument applies to then×n case will be clear.

Compare ﬁrst the six products oft’s. The ones in the expansion ofT are the
same as the ones in the expansion of the transpose; for instance,t1,2t2,3t3,1 is
Section I. Definition 353
in the top andt3,1t1,2t2,3 is in the bottom. That’s perfectly sensible—the six
in the top arise from all of the ways of picking one entry ofT from each row and
column while the six in the bottom are all of the ways of picking one entry ofT
from each column and row, so of course they are the same set.
Next observe that in the two expansions, eacht-product expression is not
necessarily associated with the same permutation matrix. For instance, on the
topt1,2t2,3t3,1 is associated with the matrix for the map1↦→2,2↦→3,3↦→1.
On the bottomt3,1t1,2t2,3 is associated with the matrix for the map1↦→3,
2↦→1, 3↦→2. The second map is inverse to the ﬁrst. This is also perfectly
sensible—both the matrix transpose and the map inverse ﬂip the1,2 to2,1,
ﬂip the2,3 to3,2, and ﬂip3,1 to1,3.
We ﬁnish by noting that the determinant ofPφ equals the determinant of
Pφ−1, as Exercise 16 shows. QED

Section II. Geometry of Determinants 355
II Geometry of Determinants
The prior section develops the determinant algebraically, by considering formulas
satisfying certain conditions. This section complements that with a geometric
approach. Beyond its intuitive appeal, an advantage of this approach is that
while we have so far only considered whether or not a determinant is zero, here
we shall give a meaning to the value of the determinant. (The prior section
treats the determinant as a function of the rows but this section focuses on
columns.)

two vectors.

1.1 DeﬁnitionIn Rn the box (or parallelepiped) formed by⟨⃗v1,..., ⃗vn⟩ is the
set {t1⃗v1 +··· +tn⃗vn |t1,...,t n∈ [0...1 ] }.
Thus the parallelogram above is the box formed by⟨
(x1

,
(x2

⟩. A three-space
box is shown in Example 1.4.
We can ﬁnd the area of the above box by drawing an enclosing rectangle and
subtracting away areas not in the box.

is no coincidence. The deﬁnition of determinants contains four properties that
we know lead to a unique function for each dimensionn. We shall argue that
these properties make good postulates for a function that measures the size of
boxes inn-space.
For instance, such a function should have the property that multiplying one
of the box-deﬁning vectors by a scalar will multiply the size by that scalar.
⃗v
⃗w
k⃗v
⃗w
Shown here isk =1.4. On the right the rescaled region is in solid lines with the
original region shaded for comparison.
That is, we can reasonably expect thatsize(...,k ⃗v,... ) =k·size(..., ⃗v,... ).
Of course, this condition is one of those in the deﬁnition of determinants.
Another property of determinants that should apply to any function mea-
suring the size of a box is that it is unaﬀected by row combinations. Here are
before-combining and after-combining boxes (the scalar shown isk = −0.35).
⃗v
⃗w
⃗v
k⃗v + ⃗w
The box formed byv andk⃗v + ⃗w slants diﬀerently than the original one but
the two have the same base and the same height, and hence the same area. So
we expect that size is not aﬀected by a shear operationsize(..., ⃗v,..., ⃗w,... ) =
size(..., ⃗v,...,k ⃗v + ⃗w,... ). Again, this is a determinant condition.
We expect that the box formed by unit vectors has unit size
⃗e1
⃗e2
and we naturally extend that to anyn-space size(⃗e1,..., ⃗en) =1.
Condition (2) of the deﬁnition of determinant is redundant, as remarked
following the deﬁnition. We know from the prior section that for eachn the
determinant exists and is unique so we know that these postulates for size
functions are consistent and that we do not need any more postulates. Therefore,
we are justiﬁed in interpretingdet(⃗v1,..., ⃗vn) as giving the size of the box
formed by the vectors.
1.2 Remark Although condition (2) is redundant it raises an important point.
Consider these two.

Swapping the columns changes the sign. On the left, starting with ⃗u and
following the arc inside the angle to⃗v (that is, going counterclockwise), we get
a positive size. On the right, starting at⃗v and going to ⃗u, and so following
the clockwise arc, gives a negative size. The sign returned by the size function
reﬂects theorientation or sense of the box. (We see the same thing if we
picture the eﬀect of scalar multiplication by a negative scalar.)
1.3 DeﬁnitionThe volume of a box is the absolute value of the determinant of a
matrix with those vectors as columns.
1.4 Example By the formula that takes the area of the base times the height, the
volume of this parallelepiped is12. That agrees with the determinant.

1.5 Theorem A transformationt : Rn→ Rn changes the size of all boxes by the
same factor, namely, the size of the image of a box|t(S)| is |T | times the size of
the box |S|, whereT is the matrix representingt with respect to the standard
basis.
That is, the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants
|TS | = |T |· |S|.
The two sentences say the same thing, ﬁrst in map terms and then in matrix
terms. This is because |t(S)| = |TS |, as both give the size of the box that is
the image of the unit boxEn under the compositiont◦s, where the maps
are represented with respect to the standard basis. We will prove the second
sentence.
Proof First consider the case thatT is singular and thus does not have an
inverse. Observe that ifTS is invertible then there is anM such that(TS )M =I,
soT (SM) =I, and soT is invertible. The contrapositive of that observation is
that ifT is not invertible then neither isTS —if |T | =0 then |TS | =0.
Now consider the case thatT is nonsingular. Any nonsingular matrix factors
into a product of elementary matricesT =E1E2··· Er. To ﬁnish this argument
we will verify that|ES| = |E|· |S| for all matricesS and elementary matricesE.
The result will then follow because |TS | = |E1··· ErS| = |E1|··· |Er|· |S| =
|E1··· Er|· |S| = |T |· |S|.
There are three types of elementary matrix. We will cover theMi(k) case;
thePi,j andCi,j(k) checks are similar. The matrixMi(k)S equalsS except that
rowi is multiplied byk. The third condition of determinant functions then
gives that |Mi(k)S| = k· |S|. But |Mi(k)| = k, again by the third condition
becauseMi(k) is derived from the identity by multiplication of rowi byk. Thus
|ES| = |E|· |S| holds forE =Mi(k). QED

The formula given in Theorem 1.5, which generalizes this example, is arecur-
rence—the determinant is expressed as a combination of determinants. This
formula isn’t circular because it gives then×n case in terms of smaller ones.
1.2 DeﬁnitionFor anyn×n matrixT, the (n −1)×(n −1) matrix formed by
deleting rowi and columnj ofT is thei,j minor ofT. Thei,j cofactor Ti,j of
T is (−1)i+j times the determinant of thei,j minor ofT.

We ﬁnish by applying Laplace’s expansion to derive a new formula for the
inverse of a matrix. With Theorem 1.5, we can calculate the determinant of a
matrix by taking linear combinations of entries from a row with their associated
cofactors.
ti,1·Ti,1 +ti,2·Ti,2 +··· +ti,n·Ti,n = |T | (∗)
Recall that a matrix with two identical rows has a zero determinant. Thus,
weighting the cofactors by entries from rowk withk⁄=i gives zero
ti,1·Tk,1 +ti,2·Tk,2 +··· +ti,n·Tk,n =0 (∗∗)
because it represents the expansion along the rowk of a matrix with rowi equal
to rowk. This summarizes (∗) and (∗∗).

Note that the order of the subscripts in the matrix of cofactors is opposite to
the order of subscripts in the other matrix; e.g., along the ﬁrst row of the matrix
of cofactors the subscripts are1,1 then2,1, etc.

Cramer’s Rule lets us by-eye solve systems that are small and simple. For
example, we can solve systems with two equations and two unknowns, or three
equations and three unknowns, where the numbers are small integers. Such
cases appear often enough that many people ﬁnd this formula handy.
But using it to solving large or complex systems is not practical, either by
hand or by a computer. A Gauss’s Method-based approach is faster.

Speed of Calculating Determinants
For large matrices, ﬁnding the determinant by using row operations is typically
much faster than using the permutation expansion. We make this statement
precise by ﬁnding how many operations each method performs.
To compare the speed of two algorithms, we ﬁnd for each one how the time
taken grows as the size of its input data set grows. For instance, if we increase
the size of the input by a factor of ten does the time taken grow by a factor of
ten, or by a factor of a hundred, or by a factor of a thousand? That is, is the
time taken proportional to the size of the data set, or to the square of that size,
or to the cube of that size, etc.? An algorithm whose time is proportional to the
square is faster than one that takes time proportional to the cube.
First consider the permutation expansion formula.
⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐

There aren! =n· (n −1)··· 2·1 diﬀerentn-permutations so for a matrix with
n rows this sum hasn! terms (and inside each term isn-many multiplications).
The factorial function grows quickly: whenn is only10 the expansion already
has10! =3,628,800 terms. Observe that growth proportional to the factorial is
bigger than growth proportional to the squaren!>n2 because multiplying the
ﬁrst two factors inn! givesn· (n −1), which for largen is approximatelyn2 and
then multiplying in more factors will make the factorial even larger. Similarly,
the factorial function grows faster thann3, etc. So an algorithm that uses the
permutation expansion formula, and thus performs a number of operations at
least as large as the factorial of the number of rows, would be very slow.
In contrast, the time taken by the row reduction method does not grow
so fast. Below is a script for row reduction in the computer language Python.
(Note: The code here is naive; for example it does not handle the case that the

involves operating on every entry in that row. That is a triply-nested loop. So
this program has a running time that is something like the cube of the number of

we may worry that the time taken by the program is dominated by the time
to store and retrieve entries from memory, rather than by the row operations.

Finding the fastest algorithm to compute the determinant is a topic of current
research. So far, researchers have found algorithms that run in time between
the square and cube of the number of rows.
The contrast between the times taken by the two determinant computation
methods of permutation expansion and row operations makes the point that
although in principle they give the same answer, in practice we want the one
with the best performance.

numbers given above. (Notice that, when an array is singular, we can sometimes

This all-integer approach is easier for mental calculations. And, using integer
arithmetic on a computer avoids some sticky issues involving ﬂoating point
calculations [Kahan]. So there are sound reasons for this approach.
Another advantage of this approach is that we can easily apply Laplace’s ex-
pansion to the ﬁrst column of (∗∗) and then get the determinant by remembering
to divide by4 because of (∗).
Here is the general3×3 case of this approach to ﬁnding the determinant.
First, assuminga1,1⁄=0, we can rescale the lower rows.
A =


0 a 3,2a1,1 −a3,1a1,2 a3,3a1,1 −a3,1a1,3


LetC be the1,1 minor. By Laplace the determinant of the above matrix is
a1,1det(C). We thus havea2
1,1det(A) = a1,1det(C) and sincea1,1⁄= 0 this
gives det(A) = det(C)/a1,1.
To do larger matrices we must see how to compute the minor’s entries. The
pattern above is that each element of the minor is a2×2 determinant. For
instance, the entry in the minor’s upper lefta2,2a1,1 −a2,1a1,2, which is the
2,2 entry in the above matrix, is the determinant of the matrix of these four
elements ofA. 

a1,1 a1,2 a1,3
a2,1 a2,2 a2,3
a3,1 a3,2 a3,3


And the minor’s lower left, the3,2 entry from above, is the determinant of the
matrix of these four. 

a1,1 a1,2 a1,3
a2,1 a2,2 a2,3
a3,1 a3,2 a3,3

Laplace’s expansion formula reduces the calculation of ann×n determinant
to the evaluation of a number of(n −1)× (n −1) ones. Chiò’s formula is
also recursive but it reduces ann×n determinant to a single(n −1)×(n −1)
determinant, calculated from a number of2×2 determinants. However, for large
matrices Gauss’s Method is better than either of these; for instance, it takes
roughly half as many operations as Chiò’s Method [Fuller & Logan].

Projective Geometry
There are geometries other than the familiar Euclidean one. One such geometry
arose when artists observed that what a viewer sees is not necessarily what is
there. As an example, here is Leonardo da Vinci’sThe Last Supper.
Look at where the ceiling meets the left and right walls. In the room those lines
are parallel but da Vinci has painted lines that, if extended, would intersect.
The intersection is thevanishing point. This aspect of perspective is familiar
as an image of railroad tracks that appear to converge at the horizon.
Da Vinci has adopted a model of how we see. Imagine a person viewing a
room. From the person’s eye, in every direction, carry a ray outward until it
intersects something, such as a point on the line where the wall meets the ceiling.
This ﬁrst intersection point is what the person sees in that direction. Overall
what the person sees is the collection of three-dimensional intersection points
projected to a common two dimensional image.

Topic: Projective Geometry 381
This is acentral projectionfrom a single point. As the sketch shows, this
projection is not orthogonal like the ones we have seen earlier because the line
from the viewer toC is not orthogonal to the image plane. (This model is only
an approximation—it does not take into account such factors as that we have
binocular vision or that our brain’s processing greatly aﬀects what we perceive.
Nonetheless the model is interesting, both artistically and mathematically.)
The operation of central projection preserves some geometric properties, for
instance lines project to lines. However, it fails to preserve some others. One
example is that equal length segments can project to segments of unequal length
(above,AB is longer thanBC because the segment projected toAB is closer to
the viewer and closer things look bigger). The study of the eﬀects of central
projections is projective geometry.
There are three cases of central projection. The ﬁrst is the projection done
by a movie projector.
projectorP sourceS image I
We can think that each source point is pushed from the domain planeS outward
to the image planeI. The second case of projection is that of the artist pulling
the source back to a canvas.
painterP image I sourceS
The two are diﬀerent because ﬁrstS is in the middle and thenI. One more
conﬁguration can happen, withP in the middle. An example of this is when we
use a pinhole to shine the image of a solar eclipse onto a paper.
382 Chapter Four. Determinants
sourceS pinhole P image I
Although the three are not exactly the same, they are similar. We shall say
that each is a central projection byP ofS toI. We next look at three models of
central projection, of increasing abstractness but also of increasing uniformity.
The last model will bring out the linear algebra.
Consider again the eﬀect of railroad tracks that appear to converge to a point.
Model this with parallel lines in a domain planeS and a projection via aP to
a codomain planeI. (The gray lines shown are parallel to theS plane and to
theI plane.)
S
I
P
This single setting shows all three projection cases. The ﬁrst picture below shows
P acting as a movie projector by pushing points from part ofS out to image
points on the lower half ofI. The middle picture showsP acting as the artist by
pulling points from another part ofS back to image points in the middle ofI.
In the third pictureP acts as the pinhole, projecting points fromS to the upper
part ofI. This third picture is the trickiest—the points that are projected near
to the vanishing point are the ones that are far out on the lower left ofS. Points
inS that are near to the vertical gray line are sent high up onI.

There are two awkward things here. First, neither of the two points in the
domain nearest to the vertical gray line (see below) has an image because a
projection from those two is along the gray line that is parallel to the codomain
plane (we say that these two are projected to inﬁnity). The second is that the
vanishing point inI isn’t the image of any point fromS because a projection to
this point would be along the gray line that is parallel to the domain plane (we
say that the vanishing point is the image of a projection from inﬁnity).

For a model that eliminates this awkwardness, cover the projectorP with
a hemispheric dome. In any direction, deﬁned by a line through the origin,
project anything in that direction to the single spot on the dome where the line
intersects. This includes projecting things such asQ1 on the line betweenP and
the dome, as with the movie projector. It includes projecting things such asQ2
on the line further fromP than the dome, as with the painter. More subtly, it
also includes projecting things such asQ3 that lie behindP, as with the pinhole.

any representative member of the line, so that the projective point shown above

384 Chapter Four. Determinants
This picture and deﬁnition clariﬁes central projection but there is still
something ungainly about the dome model: what happens whenP looks down?
Consider, in the sketch above, the part ofP’s line of sight that comes up towards
us, out of the page. Imagine that this part of the line falls, to the equator and
below. Now the part of the line𝓁 that intersects the dome lies behind the page.
That is, as the line of sight continues down past the equator, the projective
point suddenly shifts from the front of the dome to the back of the dome. (This
brings out that the dome does not include the entire equator or else when the
viewer is looking exactly along the equator then there would be two points in the
line that are both on the dome. Instead we deﬁne the dome so that it includes
the points on the equator with a positivey coordinate, as well as the point
wherey =0 andx is positive.) This discontinuity means that we often have to
treat equatorial points as a separate case. So while the railroad track model of
central projection has three cases, the dome has two.
We can do better, we can reduce to a model having a single case. Consider a
sphere centered at the origin. Any line through the origin intersects the sphere
in two spots, said to be antipodal. Because we associate each line through
the origin with a point in the projective plane, we can draw such a point as a
pair of antipodal spots on the sphere. Below, we show the two antipodal spots
connected by a dotted line to emphasize that they are not two diﬀerent points,
the pair of spots together make one projective point.
While drawing a point as a pair of antipodal spots on the sphere is not as intuitive
as the one-spot-per-point dome mode, on the other hand the awkwardness of
the dome model is gone in that as a line of view slides from north to south, no
sudden changes happen. This central projection model is uniform.
So far we have described points in projective geometry. What about lines?
What a viewerP at the origin sees as a line is shown below as a great circle, the
intersection of the model sphere with a plane through the origin.
Topic: Projective Geometry 385
(We’ve included one of the projective points on this line to bring out a subtlety.
Because two antipodal spots together make up a single projective point, the
great circle’s behind-the-paper part is the same set of projective points as its
in-front-of-the-paper part.) Just as we did with each projective point, we can
also describe a projective line with a triple of reals. For instance, the members
of this plane through the origin inR3
{


x
y
z

 |x +y −z =0 }
project to a line that we can describe with(1 1 −1) (using a row vector for
this typographically distinguishes lines from points). In general, for any nonzero
three-wide row vector⃗L we deﬁne the associatedline in the projective plane,
to be the setL = {k⃗L |k∈ R andk⁄=0 }.
The reason this description of a line as a triple is convenient is that in
the projective plane a pointv and a lineL are incident —the point lies on
the line, the line passes through the point—if and only if a dot product of
their representativesv1L1 +v2L2 +v3L3 is zero (Exercise 4 shows that this is
independent of the choice of representatives⃗v and ⃗L). For instance, the projective
point described above by the column vector with components1,2, and3 lies
in the projective line described by(1 1 −1), simply because any vector inR3
whose components are in ratio1 :2 :3 lies in the plane through the origin whose
equation is of the formk·x +k·y −k·z =0 for any nonzerok. That is, the
incidence formula is inherited from the three-space lines and planes of whichv
andL are projections.
Withthis, wecandoanalyticprojectivegeometry. Forinstance, theprojective
lineL = (1 1 −1) has the equation1v1 +1v2 −1v3 =0, meaning that for any
projective pointv incident with the line, any ofv’s representative homogeneous
coordinate vectors will satisfy the equation. This is true simply because those
vectors lie on the three space plane. One diﬀerence from Euclidean analytic
geometry is that in projective geometry besides talking about the equation of a
line, we also talk about the equation of a point. For the ﬁxed point
v =


1
2
3


the property that characterizes lines incident on this point is that the components
of any representatives satisfy1L1 +2L2 +3L3 =0 and so this is the equation of
v.
386 Chapter Four. Determinants
This symmetry of the statements about lines and points is theDuality
Principle of projective geometry: in any true statement, interchanging ‘point’
with ‘line’ results in another true statement. For example, just as two distinct
points determine one and only one line, in the projective plane two distinct lines
determine one and only one point. Here is a picture showing two projective lines
that cross in antipodal spots and thus cross at one projective point.
(∗)
Contrast this with Euclidean geometry, where two unequal lines may have a
unique intersection or may be parallel. In this way, projective geometry is
simpler, more uniform, than Euclidean geometry.
That simplicity is relevant because there is a relationship between the two
spaces: we can view the projective plane as an extension of the Euclidean plane.
Draw the sphere model of the projective plane as the unit sphere inR3. Take
Euclidean2-space to be the planez =1. As shown below, all of the points on the
Euclidean plane are projections of antipodal spots from the sphere. Conversely,
we can view some points in the projective plane as corresponding to points in
Euclidean space. (Note that projective points on the equator don’t correspond
to points on the Euclidean plane; instead we say these project out to inﬁnity.)
(∗∗)
Thus we can think of projective space as consisting of the Euclidean plane with
some extra points adjoined—the Euclidean plane is embedded in the projective
plane. The extra points in projective space, the equatorial points, are called
ideal pointsor points at inﬁnityand the equator is called theideal lineor
line at inﬁnity(it is not a Euclidean line, it is a projective line).
The advantage of this extension from the Euclidean plane to the projective
plane is that some of the nonuniformity of Euclidean geometry disappears. For
instance, the projective lines shown above in (∗) cross at antipodal spots, a
single projective point. If we put those lines into (∗∗) then they correspond to
Euclidean lines that are parallel. That is, in moving from the Euclidean plane to
Topic: Projective Geometry 387
the projective plane, we move from having two cases, that distinct lines either
intersect or are parallel, to having only one case, that distinct lines intersect
(possibly at a point at inﬁnity).
A disadvantage of the projective plane is that we don’t have the same
familiarity with it as we have with the Euclidean plane. Doing analytic geometry
intheprojectiveplanehelpsbecausetheequationsleadustotherightconclusions.
Analytic projective geometry uses linear algebra. For instance, for three points
of the projective planet,u, andv, setting up the equations for those points by
ﬁxing vectors representing each shows that the three are collinear if and only
if the resulting three-equation system has inﬁnitely many row vector solutions
representing their line. That in turn holds if and only if this determinant is zero.

Thus, three points in the projective plane are collinear if and only if any three
representative column vectors are linearly dependent. Similarly, by duality, three
lines in the projective plane are incident on a single point if and only if any
three row vectors representing them are linearly dependent.
The following result is more evidence of the niceness of the geometry of
the projective plane. These two triangles arein perspectivefrom the pointO

We will prove this using projective geometry. (We’ve drawn Euclidean ﬁgures
because that is the more familiar image. To consider them as projective ﬁgures
we can imagine that, although the line segments shown are parts of great circles
and so are curved, the model has such a large radius compared to the size of the
ﬁgures that the sides appear in our sketch to be straight.)
For the proof we need a preliminary lemma [Coxeter]: ifW,X,Y,Z are four
points in the projective plane, no three of which are collinear, then there are
homogeneous coordinate vectors⃗w, ⃗x, ⃗y, and ⃗z for the projective points, and a
basisB for R3, satisfying this.

To prove the lemma, becauseW,X, andY are not on the same projective line,
any homogeneous coordinate vectors⃗w0, ⃗x0, and ⃗y0 do not line on the same
plane through the origin inR3 and so form a spanning set forR3. Thus any
homogeneous coordinate vector forZ is a combination⃗z0 =a· ⃗w0 +b·⃗x0 +c· ⃗y0.
Then let the basis beB =⟨⃗w, ⃗x, ⃗y⟩ and take ⃗w =a· ⃗w0, ⃗x =b· ⃗x0, ⃗y =c· ⃗y0,
and ⃗z = ⃗z0.
To prove Desargue’s Theorem use the lemma to ﬁx homogeneous coordinate
vectors and a basis.

The projective lineT1U1 is the projection of a plane through the origin inR3.
One way to get its equation is to note that any vector in it is linearly dependent
on the vectors forT1 andU1 and so this determinant is zero.

Finish the proof by noting that these projective points are on one projective
line because the sum of the three homogeneous coordinate vectors is zero.
Every projective theorem has a translation to a Euclidean version, although
the Euclidean result may be messier to state and prove. Desargue’s theorem
illustrates this. In the translation to Euclidean space, we must treat separately
the case whereO lies on the ideal line, for then the linesT1T2,U1U2, andV1V2
are parallel.
The remark following the statement of Desargue’s Theorem suggests thinking
of the Euclidean pictures as ﬁgures from projective geometry for a sphere model
with very large radius. That is, just as a small area of the world seems to people
living there to be ﬂat, the projective plane is locally Euclidean.
We ﬁnish by describing one more thing about the projective plane. Although
its local properties are familiar, the projective plane has a perhaps unfamiliar
global property. The picture below shows a projective point. As we have
described above, it is made up of two antipodal spots,Q1 andQ2, but it is a
single point in the projective plane. At that point we have drawn Cartesian

axes,xy-axes. These axes appear in the picture at both antipodal spots, one in
the northern hemisphere atQ1 and the other in the south atQ2. Observe that
in the northern hemisphere the positivex axis points to the right. That is, a
person who puts their right hand on the sphere, palm down, with their thumb
on they axis will have their ﬁngers pointing with the positivex-axis.
Q1
Q2
The sequence of pictures below show a trip around this space along the projective
line:Q1 moves up and over the north pole, ending on the far side of the sphere,
and its companionQ2 comes to the front. (Be careful: this trip is not halfway
around the projective plane. It is a full circuit. The antipodal spots at either
end of the dotted line form a single projective point. So by the third picture
the trip has pretty much returned to the same projective point where it started
from.)

Q2
At the end of the circuit, thex part of thexy-axes sticks out in the other
direction. That is, for a person to put their thumb on they-axis and have
their ﬁngers point positively on thex-axis, they must use their left hand. The
projective plane is not orientable—in this geometry, left and right handedness
are not ﬁxed properties of ﬁgures. For instance, we cannot describe a spiral as
clockwise or counterclockwise.
This exhibition of the existence of a non-orientable space raises the question
of whether our universe orientable. Could an astronaut leave earth right-handed
and return left-handed? [Gardner] is a nontechnical reference. [Clarke] is a
classic science ﬁction story about orientation reversal.
For an overview of projective geometry see [Courant & Robbins]. The ap-
proach we’ve taken here, the analytic approach, leads to quick theorems and
illustrates the power of linear algebra; see [Hanes], [Ryan], and [Eggar]. But
another approach, the synthetic approach of deriving the results from an axiom
system, is both extraordinarily beautiful and is also the historical route of
development. Two ﬁne sources for this approach are [Coxeter] or [Seidenberg].
An easy and interesting application is in [Davies].

All of the points on a line through the origin project to the same spot.
In that topic we deﬁned that for any nonzero vector⃗v∈ R3, the associated
pointp in the projective planeis the set{k⃗v |k∈ R andk⁄=0 }. This is the
collection of nonzero vectors lying on the same line through the origin as⃗v.
To describe a projective point we can give any representative member of the

Topic: Computer Graphics 393
In this topic we will show how to use these ideas to perform some eﬀects
from computer graphics. For that we will take the prior picture and redraw it
without the sphere, with a movie projector at the origin, and with planez =1
looking like a movie theater screen.

We can adapt the things we have already seen about matrices to perform the
transformations. Rotation is an example. This matrix rotates in the planez =1
about the origin by the angleθ.

then we get the same result as if we had ﬁrst moved to the plane and then

So there is no harm in working with homogeneous coordinates. But what is
the advantage?
The computer graphic operation of translation, of sliding things from one
place to another, is not a linear transformation because it does not leave the
origin ﬁxed. But if we work with homogeneous coordinates then we can use
matrices. This matrix will translate points in the plane of interest bytx in the
x direction andty in they direction.


1 0 t x
0 1 t y
0 0 1




a



a +tx·c
b +ty·c
c

↦→


a/c +tx
b/c +ty
1


That is, in the plane of interest this matrix slides
(a/c
b/c
)
to
(a/c+tx
b/c+ty
)
. So the
homogeneous coordinates allow us to use matrices.
OK then, but what is the advantages of using these matrices? What does the
extra coordinate get us? Suppose that we are making a movie with computer
graphics. We are at a moment where the camera is panning and rotating at
the same time. Every single point in the scene needs to be both translated
and rotated. Rather than have the computer perform two operations to each
point, we can multiply the two matrices and then the computer only applies one
operation to each point; it multiplies that point by the resulting matrix. That
is a tremendous speedup and simpliﬁcation.
We will list some examples of the eﬀects that we can get. We have already
talked about rotation. Here is the picture of rotation by a half radian.
↦→
And here is a translation withtx =1.5 andty =0.5.

Next is scaling. This matrix rescales things in the target plane by a factor
ofs in thex-direction, and by a factor oft in they direction.

In this picture we rescale in thex direction by a factor ofs =2.5 and in the
y-direction byt =0.75.

If we takes =t then the entire shape is rescaled. For instance, if we string
together frames withs =t =1.10 then in the movie it will seem that the object
is getting closer to us.
We can reﬂect the object. This reﬂects about the liney =x.

A major advantage of having this all be matrices is that we can do complex
things by combining simple things. To reﬂect about the liney = −x +2 we
can ﬁnd the three matrices to slide everything to the origin, then reﬂect about
y = −x, and then slide back.

is, the matrix on the right describes sliding all points in the plane of interest by

slides all points back.)

We have shown that for any homomorphism there are basesB andD such that
the matrix representing the map has a block partial-identity form.

This representation describes the map as sendingc1⃗β1 +··· +cn⃗βn toc1⃗δ1 +
··· +ck⃗δk + ⃗0 +··· + ⃗0, wheren is the dimension of the domain andk is the
dimension of the range. Under this representation the action of the map is easy
to understand because most of the matrix entries are zero.
This chapter considers the special case where the domain and codomain are
the same. Here we naturally ask for the domain basis and codomain basis to be
the same. That is, we want a basisB so thatRepB,B(t) is as simple as possible,
where we take ‘simple’ to mean that it has many zeroes. We will ﬁnd that we
cannot always get a matrix having the above block partial-identity form but we
will develop a form that comes close, a representation that is nearly diagonal.
I Complex Vector Spaces
This chapter requires that we factor polynomials. But many polynomials do not
factor over the real numbers; for instance,x2 +1 does not factor into a product
of two linear polynomials with real coeﬃcients; instead it requires complex
numbersx2 +1 = (x −i)(x +i).
398 Chapter Five. Similarity
Consequently in this chapter we shall use complex numbers for our scalars,
including entries in vectors and matrices. That is, we shift from studying vector
spaces over the real numbers to vector spaces over the complex numbers. Any
real number is a complex number and in this chapter most of the examples use
only real numbers but nonetheless, the critical theorems require that the scalars
be complex. So this ﬁrst section is a review of complex numbers.
In this book our approach is to shift to this more general context of taking
scalars to be complex for the pragmatic reason that we must do so in order
to move forward. However, the idea of doing vector spaces by taking scalars
from a structure other than the real numbers is an interesting and useful one.
Delightful presentations that take this approach from the start are in [Halmos]
and [Hoﬀman & Kunze].
I.1 Polynomial Factoring and Complex Numbers
This subsection is a review only. For a full development, including proofs,
see [Ebbinghaus].
Consider a polynomialp(x) =cnxn +··· +c1x +c0 with leading coeﬃcient
cn⁄= 0. The degree of the polynomial isn. If n = 0 then p is a constant
polynomialp(x) =c0. Constant polynomials that are not the zero polynomial,
c0⁄=0, have degree zero. We deﬁne the zero polynomial to have degree−∞.
1.1 Remark Deﬁning the degree of the zero polynomial to be−∞ allows the
equation degree(fg) = degree(f) +degree(g) to hold for all polynomials.
Just as integers have a division operation—e.g., ‘4 goes5 times into21 with
remainder1’—so do polynomials.
1.2 Theorem (Division Theorem for Polynomials)Letp(x) be a polynomial. Ifd(x)
is a non-zero polynomial then there arequotient and remainder polynomials
q(x) andr(x) such that
p(x) =d(x)·q(x) +r(x)
where the degree ofr(x) is strictly less than the degree ofd(x).
The point of the integer statement ‘4 goes5 times into21 with remainder
1’ is that the remainder is less than4—while 4 goes5 times, it does not go6
times. Similarly, the ﬁnal clause of the polynomial division statement is crucial.
1.3 Example Ifp(x) =2x3 −3x2 +4x andd(x) =x2 +1 thenq(x) =2x −3 and
Section I. Complex Vector Spaces 399
r(x) =2x +3. Note thatr(x) has a lower degree than doesd(x).
1.4 Corollary The remainder when p(x) is divided byx −λ is the constant
polynomialr(x) =p(λ).
Proof The remainder must be a constant polynomial because it is of degree less
than the divisorx −λ. To determine the constant, take the theorem’s divisor
d(x) to bex −λ and substituteλ forx. QED
If a divisord(x) goes into a dividendp(x) evenly, meaning thatr(x) is the
zero polynomial, thend(x) is a called a factor ofp(x). Any root of the factor,
anyλ∈ R such thatd(λ) =0, is a root ofp(x) sincep(λ) =d(λ)·q(λ) =0.
1.5 Corollary Ifλ is a root of the polynomialp(x) thenx −λ dividesp(x) evenly,
that is,x −λ is a factor ofp(x).
Proof By the above corollaryp(x) = (x −λ)·q(x) +p(λ). Sinceλ is a root,
p(λ) =0 sox −λ is a factor. QED
A repeated root of a polynomial is a numberλ such that the polynomial is
evenly divisible by(x −λ)n for some power larger than one. The largest such
power is called the multiplicity ofλ.
Finding the roots and factors of a high-degree polynomial can be hard.
But for second-degree polynomials we have the quadratic formula: the roots of
ax2 +bx +c are these
λ1 = −b +
√
b2 −4ac
2a λ2 = −b −
√
b2 −4ac
2a
(if the discriminantb2 −4ac is negative then the polynomial has no real number
roots). A polynomial that cannot be factored into two lower-degree polynomials
with real number coeﬃcients is said to be irreducible over the reals.
1.6 Theorem Any constant or linear polynomial is irreducible over the reals. A
quadratic polynomial is irreducible over the reals if and only if its discriminant
is negative. No cubic or higher-degree polynomial is irreducible over the reals.
1.7 Corollary Any polynomial with real coeﬃcients factors into a product of linear
and irreducible quadratic polynomials with real coeﬃcients. That factorization is
unique; any two factorizations have the same factors raised to the same powers.
Note the analogy with the prime factorization of integers. In both cases the
uniqueness clause is very useful.

1.8 Example Because of uniqueness we know, without multiplying them out, that
(x +3)2(x2 +1)3 does not equal(x +3)4(x2 +x +1)2.
1.9Example Byuniqueness, ifc(x) =m(x)·q(x)thenwhere c(x) = (x−3)2(x+2)3
andm(x) = (x −3)(x +2)2, we know thatq(x) = (x −3)(x +2).
Whilex2+1has no real roots and so doesn’t factor over the real numbers, if we
imagine a root—traditionally denotedi, so thati2 +1 =0—then x2 +1 factors
into a product of linears(x−i)(x+i). When we adjoin this rooti to the reals and
close the new system with respect to addition and multiplication then we have
the complex numbers C = {a +bi |a,b∈ R andi2 = −1 }. (These are often
pictured on a plane witha plotted on the horizontal axis andb on the vertical;
note that the distance of the point from the origin is|a +bi| =
√
a2 +b2.)
In C all quadratics factor. That is, in contrast with the reals,C has no
irreducible quadratics.

Next, computing the matrix for the right-hand side involves ﬁnding the eﬀect
of the identity map on the elements ofB. Of course, the identity map does
not transform them at all so to ﬁnd the matrix we representB’s elements with
respect toD.

Multiplying out gives the same matrixˆT as we found above.
1.2 DeﬁnitionThe matricesT and ˆT are similar if there is a nonsingularP such
that ˆT =PTP −1.
Since nonsingular matrices are square,T and ˆT must be square and of the same
size. Exercise 15 checks that similarity is an equivalence relation.
1.3 Example The deﬁnition does not require that we consider a map. Calculation
with these two

In this case in the similarity equationˆT = PTP −1, the columns ofP are the

Matrix similarity is a special case of matrix equivalence so if two matrices
are similar then they are matrix equivalent. What about the converse: if they
are square, must any two matrix equivalent matrices be similar? No; the matrix
equivalence class of an identity matrix consists of all nonsingular matrices of
that size while the prior example shows that the only member of the similarity
class of an identity matrix is itself. Thus these two are matrix equivalent but
not similar.

So some matrix equivalence classes split into two or more similarity classes—

To understand the similarity relation we shall study the similarity classes.
We approach this question in the same way that we’ve studied both the row
equivalence and matrix equivalence relations, by ﬁnding a canonical form for
representatives of the similarity classes, called Jordan form. With this canonical
form, we can decide if two matrices are similar by checking whether they are in
a class with the same representative. We’ve also seen with both row equivalence
and matrix equivalence that a canonical form gives us insight into the ways in
which members of the same class are alike (e.g., two identically-sized matrices
are matrix equivalent if and only if they have the same rank).

II.2 Diagonalizability
The prior subsection shows that although similar matrices are necessarily matrix
equivalent, the converse does not hold. Some matrix equivalence classes break
into two or more similarity classes; for instance, the nonsingular2×2 matrices
form one matrix equivalence class but more than one similarity class.
The diagram below illustrates. Solid curves show the matrix equivalence
classes while dashed dividers mark the similarity classes. Each star is a matrix
representing its similarity class. We cannot use the canonical form for matrix
equivalence, a block partial-identity matrix, as a canonical form for similarity
because each matrix equivalence class has only one partial identity matrix.

408 Chapter Five. Similarity
To develop a canonical form for representatives of the similarity classes we
naturally build on previous work. So, if a similarity class does contain a partial
identity matrix then it should represent that class. Beyond that, representatives
should be as simple as possible.
The simplest extension of the partial identity form is diagonal form.
2.1 DeﬁnitionA transformation isdiagonalizable if it has a diagonal represen-
tation with respect to the same basis for the codomain as for the domain. A
diagonalizable matrix is one that is similar to a diagonal matrix:T is diagonal-
izable if there is a nonsingularP such thatPTP −1 is diagonal.
2.2 Example The matrix (
4 −2
1 1

(
−1 2
1 −1
)(
4 −2
1 1

)−1
Below we will see how to ﬁnd the matrixP but ﬁrst we note that not every
matrix is similar to a diagonal matrix, so diagonal form will not suﬃce as a
canonical form for similarity.
2.3 Example This matrix is not diagonalizable.
N =
(
0 0
1 0
)
The fact thatN is not the zero matrix means that it cannot be similar to the
zero matrix, because the zero matrix is similar only to itself. Thus ifN were to
be similar to a diagonal matrixD thenD would have at least one nonzero entry
on its diagonal.
The crucial point is that a power ofN is the zero matrix, speciﬁcallyN2 is
the zero matrix. This implies that for any mapn represented byN with respect
to someB,B, the compositionn◦n is the zero map. This in turn implies that
any matrix representingn with respect to someˆB,ˆB has a square that is the
zero matrix. But for any nonzero diagonal matrixD2, the entries ofD2 are the
squares of the entries ofD, soD2 cannot be the zero matrix. ThusN is not
diagonalizable.
So not every similarity class contains a diagonal matrix. We now characterize
when a matrix is diagonalizable.

410 Chapter Five. Similarity
Focus ﬁrst on the bottom equation. There are two cases: eitherb2 =0 orx =1.
In theb2 =0 case the ﬁrst equation gives that eitherb1 =0 orx =3. Since
we’ve disallowed the possibility that bothb2 =0 andb1 =0, we are left with
the ﬁrst diagonal entryλ1 =3. With that, (∗)’s ﬁrst equation is0·b1 +2·b2 =0
and so associated withλ1 =3 are vectors having a second component of zero

equation is2·b1 +2·b2 =0 and so associated with this case are vectors whose

We will next focus on the property of Lemma 2.4.
3.1 DeﬁnitionA transformationt :V→V has a scalareigenvalue λ if there is a
nonzero eigenvector ⃗ζ∈V such thatt(⃗ζ) =λ· ⃗ζ.
“Eigen” is German for “characteristic of” or “peculiar to.” Some authors call these
characteristic values and vectors. No authors call them “peculiar” vectors.

wherex andy are scalars that are not both zero.
In contrast, a number that is not an eigenvalue of this map is2, since
assuming thatπ doubles a vector leads to the three equationsx =2x,y =2y,
and0 =2z, and thus no non-⃗0 vector is doubled.
Note that the deﬁnition requires that the eigenvector be non-⃗0. Some authors
allow ⃗0 as an eigenvector forλ as long as there are also non-⃗0 vectors associated
withλ. The key point is to disallow the trivial case whereλ is such thatt(⃗v) =λ⃗v
for only the single vector⃗v = ⃗0.
Also, note that the eigenvalueλ could be0. The issue is whether⃗ζ equals ⃗0.
3.3 Example The only transformation on the trivial space{⃗0 } is ⃗0↦→ ⃗0. This
map has no eigenvalues because there are no non-⃗0 vectors ⃗v mapped to a scalar
multipleλ· ⃗v of themselves.
3.4 Example Consider the homomorphismt : P1→ P1 given byc0 +c1x↦→
(c0 +c1) + (c0 +c1)x. While the codomainP1 oft is two-dimensional, its range
is one-dimensional R(t) = {c +cx |c∈ C }. Application oft to a vector in that
range will simply rescale the vectorc +cx↦→ (2c) + (2c)x. That is,t has an
eigenvalue of2 associated with eigenvectors of the formc +cx, wherec⁄=0.
This map also has an eigenvalue of0 associated with eigenvectors of the form
c −cx wherec⁄=0.
The deﬁnition above is for maps. We can give a matrix version.
3.5 DeﬁnitionA square matrixT has a scalareigenvalue λ associated with the
nonzero eigenvector ⃗ζ ifT⃗ζ =λ· ⃗ζ.
This extension of the deﬁnition for maps to a deﬁnition for matrices is natural
but there is a point on which we must take care. The eigenvalues of a map are also
the eigenvalues of matrices representing that map, and so similar matrices have
the same eigenvalues. However, the eigenvectors can diﬀer—similar matrices
need not have the same eigenvectors. The next example explains.

then it “assumes” that column vectors are representations with respect toE2.

3.9 Deﬁnition The characteristic polynomial of a square matrixT is the
determinant |T −xI| where x is a variable. The characteristic equation is
|T −xI| = 0. The characteristic polynomial of a transformationt is the
characteristic polynomial of any matrix representation RepB,B(t).
The characteristic polynomial of an n×n matrix, or of a transformation
t : Cn→ Cn, is of degreen. Exercise 35 checks that the characteristic polynomial
of a transformation is well-deﬁned, that is, that the characteristic polynomial is
the same no matter which basis we use for the representation.
3.10 Lemma A linear transformation on a nontrivial vector space has at least
one eigenvalue.
Proof Any root of the characteristic polynomial is an eigenvalue. Over the
complex numbers, any polynomial of degree one or greater has a root.QED
3.11 Remark That result is the reason that in this chapter we use scalars that
are complex numbers. Had we stuck to real number scalars then there would be
characteristic polynomials, such asx2 +1, that do not factor.
Section II. Similarity 417
3.12 Deﬁnition The eigenspace of a transformationt associated with the
eigenvalue λ isVλ = {⃗ζ |t(⃗ζ ) =λ⃗ζ }. The eigenspace of a matrix is analogous.
3.13 Lemma An eigenspace is a subspace. It is a nontrivial subspace.
Proof Notice ﬁrst thatVλ is not empty; it contains the zero vector sincet(⃗0) = ⃗0,
which equalsλ· ⃗0. To show that an eigenspace is a subspace, what remains is to
check closure of this set under linear combinations. Take⃗ζ1,..., ⃗ζn∈Vλ and
then
t(c1⃗ζ1 +c2⃗ζ2 +··· +cn⃗ζn) =c1t(⃗ζ1) +··· +cnt(⃗ζn)
=c1λ⃗ζ1 +··· +cnλ⃗ζn
=λ(c1⃗ζ1 +··· +cn⃗ζn)
that the combination is also an element ofVλ.
The spaceVλ contains more than just the zero vector because by deﬁnition
λ is an eigenvalue only ift(⃗ζ ) =λ⃗ζ has solutions for⃗ζ other than⃗0. QED
3.14 Example These are the eigenspaces associated with the eigenvalues0 and2
of Example 3.7.

ple 3.8.
Vπ = {
(

)
|a∈ C } V3 = {
(
−b/(π −3)
b
)
|b∈ C }
The characteristic equation in Example 3.7 is0 =x(x −2)2 so in some sense
2 is an eigenvalue twice. However there are not twice as many eigenvectors in
that the dimension of the associated eigenspaceV2 is one, not two. The next
example is a case where a number is a double root of the characteristic equation
and the dimension of the associated eigenspace is two.

Note thatV1 has dimension two.
3.17 DeﬁnitionWhere a characteristic polynomial factors into(x −λ1)m1··· (x −
λk)mk then the eigenvalueλi has algebraic multiplicitymi. Its geometric
multiplicity is the dimension of the associated eigenspaceVλi.
In Example 3.16, there are two eigenvalues, Forλ1 =1 both the algebraic
and geometric multiplicities are2. Forλ2 =0 both the algebraic and geometric
multiplicities are1. In contrast, Example 3.14 shows that the eigenvalueλ =2
has algebraic multiplicity2 but geometric multiplicity1. For every transforma-
tion, each eigenvalue has geometric multiplicity greater than or equal to1 by
Lemma 3.13. (And, an eigenvalue must have geometric multiplicity less than or
equal to its algebraic multiplicity, although proving this is beyond our scope.)
By Lemma 3.13 if two eigenvectors⃗v1 and ⃗v2 are associated with the same
eigenvaluethenalinearcombinationofthosetwoisalsoaneigenvector, associated
with the same eigenvalue. As an illustration, referring to the prior example, this
sum of two members ofV1 

eigenspaces.
Section II. Similarity 419
3.18 Theorem For any set of distinct eigenvalues of a map or matrix, a set of
associated eigenvectors, one per eigenvalue, is linearly independent.
Proof We will use induction on the number of eigenvalues. The base step is
that there are zero eigenvalues. Then the set of associated vectors is empty and
so is linearly independent.
For the inductive step assume that the statement is true for any set of
k >0 distinct eigenvalues. Consider distinct eigenvaluesλ1,...,λ k+1 and let
⃗v1,..., ⃗vk+1 be associated eigenvectors. Suppose that⃗0 =c1⃗v1 +··· +ck⃗vk +
ck+1⃗vk+1. Derive two equations from that, the ﬁrst by multiplying byλk+1 on
both sides ⃗0 =c1λk+1⃗v1 +··· +ck+1λk+1⃗vk+1 and the second by applying the
map to both sides⃗0 =c1t(⃗v1)+··· +ck+1t(⃗vk+1) =c1λ1⃗v1 +··· +ck+1λk+1⃗vk+1
(applying the matrix gives the same result). Subtract the second from the ﬁrst.
⃗0 =c1(λk+1 −λ1)⃗v1 +··· +ck(λk+1 −λk)⃗vk +ck+1(λk+1 −λk+1)⃗vk+1
The ⃗vk+1 term vanishes. Then the induction hypothesis gives thatc1(λk+1 −
λ1) =0, ..., ck(λk+1 −λk) =0. The eigenvalues are distinct so the coeﬃcients
c1,...,c k are all0. With that we are left with the equation⃗0 =ck+1⃗vk+1 so
ck+1 is also0. QED

This section observes that some matrices are similar to a diagonal matrix.
The idea of eigenvalues arose as the entries of that diagonal matrix, although
the deﬁnition applies more broadly than just to diagonalizable matrices. To ﬁnd
eigenvalues we deﬁned the characteristic equation and that led to the ﬁnal result,
Section II. Similarity 421
a criterion for diagonalizability. (While it is useful for the theory, note that in
applications ﬁnding eigenvalues this way is typically impractical; for one thing
the matrix may be large and ﬁnding roots of large-degree polynomials is hard.)
In the next section we study matrices that cannot be diagonalized.

This chapter shows that every square matrix is similar to one that is a sum of
two kinds of simple matrices. The prior section focused on the ﬁrst simple kind,
diagonal matrices. We now consider the other kind.

we can composet with itselft2 =t◦t, andt3 =t◦t◦t, etc.∗

Note that the superscript power notationtj for iterates of the transformations
ﬁts with the notation that we’ve used for their square matrix representations
because if RepB,B(t) =T then RepB,B(tj) =Tj.

These examples suggest that after some number of iterations the map settles
down.
1.4 Lemma For any transformationt :V→V, the range spaces of the powers
form a descending chain
V⊇ R(t)⊇ R(t2)⊇···
and the null spaces form an ascending chain.
{⃗0 }⊆ N (t)⊆ N (t2)⊆···
Further, there is ak > 0such that for powers less thank the subsets are
proper: if ifj<k then R(tj)⊃ R(tj+1) and N (tj)⊂ N (tj+1), while ifj >k
then R(tj) = R(tj+1) and N (tj) = N (tj+1)).
(Thek =1 case can happen, for instance ift is the identity map, so that in the
chains none of the subsets are proper subsets.)
426 Chapter Five. Similarity
Proof First recall that for any map the dimension of its range space plus
the dimension of its null space equals the dimension of its domain. So if the
dimensions of the range spaces shrink then the dimensions of the null spaces
must rise. We will do the range space half here and leave the rest for Exercise 14.
We start by showing that the range spaces form a chain. If⃗w∈ R(tj+1), so
that ⃗w =tj+1(⃗v) for some⃗v, then ⃗w =tj(t(⃗v) ). Thus ⃗w∈ R(tj).
Next we verify the “further” property: in the chain the subsets containments
are proper initially, and then from some powerk onward the range spaces
are equal. We ﬁrst show that if any pair of adjacent range spaces in the
chain are equal R(tk) = R(tk+1) then all subsequent ones are also equal
R(tk+1) = R(tk+2), etc. This holds because t : R(tk+1)→ R(tk+2) is the
same map, with the same domain, ast : R(tk)→ R(tk+1) and it therefore has
the same rangeR(tk+1) = R(tk+2) (it holds for all higher powers by induction).
So if the chain of range spaces ever stops strictly decreasing then from that point
onward it is stable.
We end by showing that the chain must eventually stop decreasing. Each
range space is a subspace of the one before it. For it to be a proper subspace it
must be of strictly lower dimension (see Exercise 12). These spaces are ﬁnite-
dimensional and so the chain can fall for only ﬁnitely many steps. That is, the
powerk is at most the dimension ofV. QED
1.5 Example The derivative mapa +bx +cx2 +dx3 d/dx
↦−→b +2cx +3dx2 on P3
has this chain of range spaces.
R(t0) = P3 ⊃ R(t1) = P2 ⊃ R(t2) = P1 ⊃ R(t3) = P0 ⊃ R(t4) = {⃗0 }
All later elements of the chain are the trivial space. It has this chain of null
spaces.
N (t0) = {⃗0 }⊂ N (t1) = P0 ⊂ N (t2) = P1 ⊂ N (t3) = P2 ⊂ N (t4) = P3
Later elements are the entire space.

R(t0) = P2 R(t) = {a0 +a1x |a0,a1∈ C } R(t2) = {a0 |a0∈ C }
and then stabilizes, so thatR(t2) = R(t3) =··· . The null space grows
N (t0) = {0 } N (t) = {b1x |b1∈ C } N (t2) = {b1x +b2x2 |b1,b2∈ C }
and then stabilizesN (t2) = N (t3) =··· .

mation. The vertical axis gives the dimension of the range space oftj as the

III.2 Strings
This requires material from the optional Combining Subspaces subsection.
The prior subsection shows that asj increases the dimensions of theR(tj)’s
fall while the dimensions of theN (tj)’s rise, in such a way that this rank and
nullity split between them the dimension ofV. Can we say more; do the two
split a basis—isV = R(tj)⊕ N (tj)?
The answer is yes for the smallest powerj =0 sinceV = R(t0)⊕ N (t0) =
V⊕ {⃗0 }. The answer is also yes at the other extreme.
2.1 Lemma For any lineart :V→V the functiont : R∞(t)→ R∞(t) is one-to-
one.
Proof Let the dimension ofV be n. Because R(tn) = R(tn+1), the map
t : R∞(t)→ R∞(t) is a dimension-preserving homomorphism. Therefore, by
Theorem Three.II.2.20 it is one-to-one. QED
Section III. Nilpotence 429
2.2 Corollary Wheret :V→V is a linear transformation, the space is the direct
sumV = R∞(t)⊕N∞(t). That is, both (1)dim(V) = dim(R∞(t))+dim(N∞(t))
and (2) R∞(t)∩ N∞(t) = {⃗0 }.
Proof Let the dimension ofV ben. We will verify the second sentence, which
is equivalent to the ﬁrst. Clause (1) is true because any transformation satisﬁes
that its rank plus its nullity equals the dimension of the space, and in particular
this holds for the transformationtn.
For clause (2), assume that⃗v∈ R∞(t)∩ N∞(t) to prove that⃗v = ⃗0. Because
⃗v is in the generalized null space,tn(⃗v) = ⃗0. On the other hand, by the lemma
t : R∞(t)→ R∞(t) is one-to-one and a composition of one-to-one maps is one-
to-one, sotn : R∞(t)→ R∞(t) is one-to-one. Only ⃗0 is sent by a one-to-one
linear map to⃗0 so the fact thattn(⃗v) = ⃗0 implies that⃗v = ⃗0. QED
2.3 Remark Technically there is a diﬀerence between the mapt :V→V and
the map on the subspacet : R∞(t)→ R∞(t) if the generalized range space is
not equal toV, because the domains are diﬀerent. But the diﬀerence is small
because the second is the restriction of the ﬁrst toR∞(t).
For powers betweenj =0 andj =n, the spaceV might not be the direct
sum of R(tj) and N (tj). The next example shows that the two can have a
nontrivial intersection.

2.6 Example Transformations can act via more than one string. The transforma-
tiont acting on a basisB =⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗β5⟩ by
⃗β1↦→ ⃗β2↦→ ⃗β3↦→ ⃗0
⃗β4↦→ ⃗β5↦→ ⃗0
will have, for instance,⃗β3 in the intersection of its range space and null space.
The strings make clear thatt3 is the zero map. This map is represented by a
matrix that is all zeros except for blocks of subdiagonal ones

(the lines just visually organize the blocks).
In those examples all vectors are eventually transformed to zero.
2.7 DeﬁnitionA nilpotent transformation is one with a power that is the zero
map. A nilpotent matrix is one with a power that is the zero matrix. In either
case, the least such power is theindex of nilpotency.
2.8 Example In Example 2.4 the index of nilpotency is two. In Example 2.5 it is
four. In Example 2.6 it is three.

2.9 Example The diﬀerentiation mapd/dx : P2→ P2 is nilpotent of index three
since the third derivative of any quadratic polynomial is zero. This map’s action

The new matrix is nilpotent; its fourth power is the zero matrix. We could
verify this with a tedious computation or we can instead just observe that it is
nilpotent since its fourth power is similar toˆN4, the zero matrix, and the only
matrix similar to the zero matrix is itself.

in that every nilpotent matrix is similar to one that is all zeros except for blocks
of subdiagonal ones.

because a basis cannot have a repeated vector.)

2.13 Example The linear map of diﬀerentiationd/dx : P2→ P2 is nilpotent. The
sequence⟨x2,2x,2⟩ is ad/dx-string of length3; in particular, this string satisﬁes
the requirement thatd/dx(2) = 0. Because it is a basis, that sequence is a
d/dx-string basis forP2.
2.14 Example In Example 2.6, we can concatenate thet-strings⟨⃗β1, ⃗β2, ⃗β3⟩ and
⟨⃗β4, ⃗β5⟩ to make a basis for the domain oft.
2.15 Lemma If a space has at-string basis then the index of nilpotency oft
equals the length of the longest string in that basis.
Proof Let the space have a basis oft-strings and lett’s index of nilpotency
bek. Thentk sends any vector to⃗0, and that must include including the vector
starting any string. So each string in the string basis has length at mostk.
Now instead suppose that the space has at-string basisB where all of the
strings are shorter than lengthk. Becauset has the index of nilpotencyk, there
is a⃗v such thattk−1(⃗v)⁄= ⃗0. Represent ⃗v as a linear combination of elements
fromB and applytk−1. We are supposing thattk−1 maps each element ofB
to ⃗0. It therefore maps each term in the linear combination to⃗0, contradicting
that it does not map⃗v to ⃗0. QED
We shall show that each nilpotent map has an associated string basis, a basis
of disjoint strings.
To see the main idea of the argument, imagine that we want to construct
a counterexample, a map that is nilpotent but without an associated basis of
disjoint strings. We might think to make something like the mapt : C5→ C5
with this action.

But, the fact that the shown basis isn’t disjoint doesn’t mean that there isn’t
another basis that consists of disjoint strings.
To produce such a basis for this map we will ﬁrst ﬁnd the number and lengths
of its strings. Observe thatt’s index of nilpotency is two. Lemma 2.15 says that
in a disjoint string basis at least one string has length two. There are ﬁve basis
elements so if there is a disjoint string basis then the map must act in one of
these ways.

Now, the key point. A transformation with the left-hand action has a null
space of dimension three since that’s how many basis vectors are mapped to
zero. A transformation with the right-hand action has a null space of dimension
four. With the matrix representation above we can determine which of the two
possible shapes is right.
N (t) = {



|x,z,r ∈ C }
This is three-dimensional, meaning that of the two disjoint string basis forms
above,t’s basis has the left-hand one.
To produce a string basis fort, ﬁrst pick⃗β2 and ⃗β4 from R(t)∩ N (t).
⃗β2 =

(Other choices are possible, just be sure that the set{ ⃗β2, ⃗β4 } is linearly inde-
pendent.) For ⃗β5 pick a vector fromN (t) that is not in the span of{ ⃗β2, ⃗β4 }.
⃗β5 =



Finally, take⃗β1 and ⃗β3 such thatt(⃗β1) = ⃗β2 andt(⃗β3) = ⃗β4.

2.16 Theorem Any nilpotent transformationt is associated with at-string basis.
While the basis is not unique, the number and the length of the strings is
determined byt.
This illustrates the proof, which describes three kinds of basis vectors (shown
in squares if they are in the null space and in circles if they are not).

Proof Fix a vector spaceV. We will argue by induction on the index of
nilpotency. If the mapt :V→V has index of nilpotency1 then it is the zero
map and any basis is a string basis⃗β1↦→ ⃗0, ..., ⃗βn↦→ ⃗0.
For the inductive step, assume that the theorem holds for any transformation
t :V→V with an index of nilpotency between1 andk −1 (withk>1 ) and
consider the indexk case.
Observe that the restriction oft to the range spacet : R(t)→ R(t) is also
nilpotent, of indexk −1. Apply the inductive hypothesis to get a string basis
for R(t), where the number and length of the strings is determined byt.

(In the illustration above these are the vectors of kind1.)
Note that taking the ﬁnal nonzero vector in each of these strings gives a basis
C =⟨th1 (⃗β1),...,t hi (⃗βi)⟩ for the intersectionR(t)∩ N (t). This is because a
member of R(t) maps to zero if and only if it is a linear combination of those
basis vectors that map to zero. (The illustration shows these as1’s in squares.)
Now extendC to a basis for all ofN (t).
ˆC =C
⌢
⟨⃗ξ1,..., ⃗ξp⟩
(In the illustration the⃗ξ’s are the vectors of kind2 and so the setˆC is the set of
vectors in squares.) While the vectors⃗ξ we choose aren’t uniquely determined
byt, what is uniquely determined is the number of them: it is the dimension of
N (t) minus the dimension ofR(t)∩ N (t).
Finally,B
⌢ˆC is a basis forR(t) +N (t) because any sum of something in the
range space with something in the null space can be represented using elements
ofB for the range space part and elements ofˆC for the part from the null space.
Note that
dim
(
R(t) + N (t)
)
= dim(R(t)) +dim(N (t)) −dim(R(t)∩ N (t))
= rank(t) +nullity(t) −i
= dim(V) −i
and so we can extendB
⌢ ˆC to a basis for all ofV by the addition ofi more
vectors, provided that they are not linearly dependent on what we have already.
Recall that each of⃗β1,..., ⃗βi is inR(t), and extendB
⌢ˆC with vectors⃗v1,..., ⃗vi
such thatt(⃗v1) = ⃗β1,...,t (⃗vi) = ⃗βi. (In the illustration these are the3’s.) The
check that this extension preserves linear independence is Exercise 32.QED
2.17 Corollary Every nilpotent matrix is similar to a matrix that is all zeros except
for blocks of subdiagonal ones. That is, every nilpotent map is represented with
respect to some basis by such a matrix.
This form is unique in the sense that if a nilpotent matrix is similar to two
such matrices then those two simply have their blocks ordered diﬀerently. Thus
this is a canonical form for the similarity classes of nilpotent matrices provided
that we order the blocks, say, from longest to shortest.

Because the matrix is2×2, any transformation that it represents is on a space
of dimension two. The nullspace of one application of the mapN (m) has
dimension one, and the nullspace of two applicationsN (m2) has dimension two.
Thus the action ofm on a string basis is⃗β1↦→ ⃗β2↦→ ⃗0 and the canonical form
of the matrix is this.
N =

We can exhibit such a string basis, and also the change of basis matrices
witnessing the matrix similarity betweenM andN. Suppose thatm : C2→ C2
is such thatM represents it with respect to the standard bases. (We could take
M to be a representation with respect to some other basis but the standard one
is convenient.) Pick⃗β2∈ N (m). Also pick⃗β1 so thatm(⃗β1) = ⃗β2.

application has dimension two so two basis vectors map directly to zero, the

basis vectors map to zero by the second iteration, and the null space after three

IV Jordan Form
This section uses material from three optional subsections: Combining
Subspaces, Determinants Exist, and Laplace’s Expansion.
We began this chapter by recalling that every linear maph :V→W can be
represented with respect to some basesB⊂V andD⊂W by a partial identity
matrix. Restated, the partial identity form is a canonical form for matrix
equivalence. This chapter considers the case where the codomain equals the
domain so we naturally ask what is possible when the two bases are equal, when
we have RepB,B(t). In short, we want a canonical form for matrix similarity.
We noted that in theB,B case a partial identity matrix is not always possible.
We therefore extended the matrix forms of interest to the natural generalization,
diagonal matrices, and showed that a transformation or square matrix can be
diagonalized if its eigenvalues are distinct. But we also gave an example of a
square matrix that cannot be diagonalized because it is nilpotent, and thus
diagonal form won’t suﬃce as the canonical form for matrix similarity.
The prior section developed that example to get a canonical form for nilpotent
matrices, subdiagonal ones.
This section ﬁnishes our program by showing that for any linear transforma-
tion there is a basisB such that the matrix representationRepB,B(t) is the sum
of a diagonal matrix and a nilpotent matrix. This is Jordan canonical form.
IV.1 Polynomials of Maps and Matrices
Recall that the set of square matricesMn×n is a vector space under entry-by-
entry addition and scalar multiplication, and that this space has dimensionn2.
Thus for anyn×n matrixT then2 +1-member set {I,T,T 2,...,T n2
} is linearly
dependent and so there are scalarsc0,...,c n2, not all zero, such that
cn2Tn2
+··· +c1T +c0I
is the zero matrix. Therefore every transformation has a sort of generalized
nilpotency—the powers of a square matrix cannot climb forever without a kind
of repeat.
1.1 Deﬁnition Let t be a linear transformation of a vector spaceV. Where
f(x) =cnxn +··· +c1x +c0 is a polynomial,f(t) is the transformationcntn +
··· +c1t +c0(id) onV. In the same way, ifT is a square matrix thenf(T ) is
the matrixcnTn +··· +c1T +c0I.
Section IV. Jordan Form 441
The polynomial of the matrix represents the polynomial of the map: ifT =
RepB,B(t) then f(T ) = RepB,B(f(t)). This is because Tj = RepB,B(tj), and
cT = RepB,B(ct), andT1 +T2 = RepB,B(t1 +t2).
1.2 Remark We shall write the matrix polynomial slightly diﬀerently than the
map polynomial. For instance, iff(x) =x −3 then we shall write the identity
matrix, as inf(T ) =T −3I, but not write the identity map, as inf(t) =t −3.
1.3 Example Rotation of plane vectorsπ/3radians counterclockwise is represented
with respect to the standard basis by

and verifying thatT2 −T +I =Z is routine. (Geometrically,T2 rotates by2π/3.
On the standard basis vector⃗e1, the action ofT2 −T is to give the diﬀerence
between the unit vector with angle2π/3 and the unit vector with angleπ/3,
which is
(−1

)
. On ⃗e2 it gives
(0

. SoT2 −T = −I.)
The space M2×2 has dimension four so we know that for any2×2 matrixT
there is a fourth degree polynomialf such thatf(T ) =Z. But in that example
we exhibited a degree two polynomial that works. So while degreen2 always
suﬃces, in some cases a smaller-degree polynomial is enough.
1.4 DeﬁnitionThe minimal polynomialm(x) of a transformationt or a square
matrixT is the non-zero polynomial of least degree and with leading coeﬃcient1
such thatm(t) is the zero map orm(T ) is the zero matrix.
A minimal polynomial cannot be a constant polynomial because of the restriction
on the leading coeﬃcient. So a minimal polynomial must have degree at least
one. The zero matrix has minimal polynomialp(x) =x while the identity matrix
has minimal polynomialˆp(x) =x −1.
1.5 Lemma Any transformation or square matrix has a unique minimal polyno-
mial.
Proof First we prove existence. By the earlier observation that degreen2
suﬃces, there is at least one nonzero polynomialp(x) = ckxk +··· +c0 that
takes the map or matrix to zero. From among all such polynomials take one
with the smallest degree. Divide this polynomial by its leading coeﬃcientck to
get a leading1. Hence any map or matrix has at least one minimal polynomial.
Now for uniqueness. Suppose thatm(x) and ˆm(x) both take the map or
matrix to zero, are both of minimal degree and are thus of equal degree, and
both have a leading1. Consider the diﬀerence,m(x) − ˆm(x). If it is not the zero
442 Chapter Five. Similarity
polynomial then it has a nonzero leading coeﬃcient. Dividing through by that
leading coeﬃcient would make it a polynomial that takes the map or matrix to
zero, has leading coeﬃcient1, and is of smaller degree thanm and ˆm (because
in the subtraction the leading1’s cancel). That would contradict the minimality
of the degree ofm and ˆm. Thusm(x) − ˆm(x) is the zero polynomial and the
two are equal. QED

cntn +··· +c1t +c0 =k· (t −λ1)q1◦···◦ (t −λz)qz
Consequently, ifT is a square matrix thenf(T ) andk· (T −λ1I)q1··· (T −λzI)qz
are equal matrices.
Section IV. Jordan Form 443
Proof We use induction on the degree of the polynomial. The cases where
the polynomial is of degree zero and degree one are clear. The full induction
argument is Exercise 33 but we will give its sense with the degree two case.
A quadratic polynomial factors into two linear termsf(x) =k(x −λ1)· (x −
λ2) = k(x2 + (−λ1 −λ2)x +λ1λ2). Substituting t for x in the factored and
unfactored versions gives the same map.

(
t◦t (⃗v) − (λ1 +λ2)t(⃗v) +λ1λ2⃗v
)
=k· (t2 − (λ1 +λ2)t +λ1λ2) (⃗v)
The third equality uses linearity oft to bringλ2 out of the second term.QED
The next result is that every root of the minimal polynomial is an eigenvalue
and that every eigenvalue is a root of the minimal polynomial. (That is, the resule
says ‘1 ⩽qi’ and not just ‘0 ⩽qi’.) For that, recall that to ﬁnd eigenvalues we
solve |T −xI| =0 and this determinant gives a polynomial inx, the characteristic
polynomial, whose roots are the eigenvalues.
1.8 Theorem (Cayley-Hamilton) If the characteristic polynomial of a transforma-
tion or square matrix factors into
k· (x −λ1)p1 (x −λ2)p2··· (x −λz)pz
then its minimal polynomial factors into
(x −λ1)q1 (x −λ2)q2··· (x −λz)qz
where1 ⩽qi ⩽pi for eachi between1 andz.
The proof takes up the next three lemmas. We will state them in matrix terms
because that version is convenient for the ﬁrst proof but they apply equally well
to maps.
The ﬁrst result is the key. For the proof, observe that we can view a matrix
of polynomials as a polynomial with matrix coeﬃcients.

Recall Theorem Four.III.1.9, that the product of a matrix with its adjoint equals
the determinant of the matrix times the identity.
c(x)·I = adj(C)C = adj(C)(T −xI) = adj(C)T −adj(C)·x (∗)
The left side of (∗) iscnIxn +cn−1Ixn−1 +··· +c1Ix+c0I. For the right side, the
entries ofadj(C) are polynomials, each of degree at mostn −1 since the minors
of a matrix drop a row and column. As suggested before the proof, rewrite it
as a polynomial with matrix coeﬃcients:adj(C) =Cn−1xn−1 +··· +C1x +C0
where eachCi is a matrix of scalars. Now this is the right side of (∗).
[(Cn−1T )xn−1 +··· + (C1T )x +C0T ] − [Cn−1xn +Cn−2xn−1 +··· +C0x]
Equate the left and right side of (∗)’s coeﬃcients ofxn, ofxn−1, etc.

the second equation byTn−1, etc.

Add. The left iscnTn +cn−1Tn−1 +··· +c0I. The right telescopes; for instance,
−Cn−1Tn from the ﬁrst line combines with theCn−1Tn half of the second line.
The total on the right is the zero matrix. QED
Section IV. Jordan Form 445
We refer to that result by saying that a matrix or mapsatisﬁesits charac-
teristic polynomial.
1.10 Lemma Any polynomial that is satisﬁed byT is divisible byT’s minimal
polynomial. That is, for a polynomialf(x), iff(T ) is the zero matrix thenf(x)
is divisible by the minimal polynomial ofT.
Proof Letm(x) be minimal forT. The Division Theorem for Polynomials gives
f(x) =q(x)·m(x) +r(x) where the degree ofr is strictly less than the degree of
m. BecauseT satisﬁes bothf andm, pluggingT into that equation gives that
r(T ) is the zero matrix. That contradicts the minimality ofm unlessr is the
zero polynomial. QED
Combining the prior two lemmas shows that the minimal polynomial divides
the characteristic polynomial. Thus any root of the minimal polynomial is also
a root of the characteristic polynomial.
Thus so far we have that if the minimal polynomial factors asm(x) =
(x −λ1)q1··· (x −λi)qi then the characteristic polynomial also has the rootsλ1,
..., λi. But as far as what we have established to this point, the characteristic
polynomial might have additional roots:c(x) = (x −λ1)p1··· (x −λi)pi (x −
λi+1)pi+1··· (x −λz)pz, where1 ⩽qj ⩽pj for1 ⩽j ⩽i. We ﬁnish the proof of
the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem by showing that the characteristic polynomial
has no additional roots so that there are noλi+1,λi+2, etc.
1.11 Lemma Each linear factor of the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix
is also a linear factor of the minimal polynomial.
Proof LetT be a square matrix with minimal polynomialm(x) of degreen and
assume thatx −λ is a factor of the characteristic polynomial ofT, so thatλ is
an eigenvalue ofT. We will show thatm(λ) =0, i.e., thatx −λ is a factor ofm.
Assume thatλ is associated with the eigenvector⃗v and consider the powers
T2(⃗v), ..., Tn(⃗v). We haveT2(⃗v) =T·λ⃗v =λ·T⃗v =λ2⃗v. The same happens for
all of the powers:Ti⃗v =λi⃗v for1 ⩽i ⩽n. Thus for any polynomial function
p(x), application of the matrixp(T ) to ⃗v equals the result of multiplying⃗v by
the scalarp(λ).
p(T )⃗v = (ckTk +··· +c1T +c0I)⃗v =ckTk⃗v +··· +c1T⃗v +c0⃗v
=ckλk⃗v +··· +c1λ⃗v +c0⃗v =p(λ)· ⃗v
Sincem(T ) is the zero matrix,⃗0 =m(T )(⃗v) =m(λ)· ⃗v and hencem(λ) =0, as
⃗v⁄= ⃗0 because it is an eigenvector. QED
That concludes the proof of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem.

IV.2 Jordan Canonical Form
We are looking for a canonical form for matrix similarity. This subsection
completes this program by moving from the canonical form for the classes of
nilpotent matrices to the canonical form for all classes.
2.1 Lemma A linear transformation on a nontrivial vector space is nilpotent if
and only if its only eigenvalue is zero.
Proof If the linear transformationt on a nontrivial vector space is nilpotent
then there is ann such thattn is the zero map, sot satisﬁes the polynomial
p(x) =xn = (x −0)n. By Lemma 1.10 the minimal polynomial oft dividesp, so
the minimal polynomial’s only root is zero. By Cayley-Hamilton, Theorem 1.8,
the characteristic polynomial’s only root is zero. Thust’s only eigenvalue is
zero.
Section IV. Jordan Form 449
Conversely, if a transformationt on ann-dimensional space has only the
single eigenvalue of zero then its characteristic polynomial isxn. Lemma 1.9
says that a map satisﬁes its characteristic polynomial sotn is the zero map.
Thust is nilpotent. QED
The ‘nontrivial vector space’ is in the statement of that lemma because on a
trivial space{⃗0 }the only transformation is the zero map, which has no eigenvalues
because there are no associated nonzero eigenvectors.
2.2 Corollary The transformationt−λ is nilpotent if and only ift’s only eigenvalue
isλ.
Proof The transformationt −λ is nilpotent if and only ift −λ’s only eigenvalue
is0. That holds if and only ift’s only eigenvalue isλ, becauset(⃗v) =λ⃗v if and
only if (t −λ) (⃗v) =0· ⃗v. QED
2.3 Lemma If the matricesT −λI andN are similar thenT andN +λI are also
similar, via the same change of basis matrices.
Proof WithN =P(T −λI)P−1 =PTP −1 −P(λI)P−1 we haveN =PTP −1 −
PP−1(λI) because the diagonal matrixλI commutes with anything. ThusN =
PTP −1 −λI, and thereforeN +λI =PTP −1. QED
We already have the canonical form for the case of nilpotent matrices, that is,
for the case of matrices whose only eigenvalue is zero. By Corollary III.2.17, each
such matrix is similar to one that is all zeroes except for blocks of subdiagonal
ones. The prior results let us extend this to all matrices that have a single
eigenvalueλ. In the new form, besides blocks of subdiagonal ones, all of the
entries on the diagonal areλ. (See Deﬁnition 2.6 below.)
2.4 Example The characteristic polynomial of
T =
(
2 −1
1 4
)
is (x −3)2 and soT has a single eigenvalue,3.
Because3 is the only eigenvalue,T −3I has the single eigenvalue of0 and
is therefore nilpotent. To get the canonical form ofT, start by ﬁnding a string
basis forT −3I as in the prior section, computing the powers of this matrix and
the null spaces of those powers.

The null space oft −3 has dimension one and the null space of(t −3)2 has
dimension two. So this is the canonical representation matrix and the form of
the associated string basisB fort −3.

Find such a basis by ﬁrst picking a⃗β2 that is mapped to⃗0 byt −3 (that is,
pick an element of the null spaceN (t −3) given in the table). Then choose
a ⃗β1 that is mapped to ⃗0 by (t −3)2. The only restriction on the choice,
besides membership in the null space, is that⃗β1 and ⃗β2 need to form a linearly
independent set. Here is one possible choice.
⃗β1 =

2.6 DeﬁnitionA Jordan blockis a square matrix, or a square block of entries
inside of a matrix, that is all zeroes except that there is a numberλ∈ C such
that every diagonal entry isλ, and that every subdiagonal entry is1. (If the
block is1×1 then it has no subdiagonal1’s.)
The strings in the associated basis areJordan stringsor Jordan chains.
The above examples illustrate that for single-eigenvalue matrices, the Jordan
block matrices are canonical representatives of the similarity classes. We can
make this matrix form unique by arranging the basis elements so that the blocks
of subdiagonal ones go from longest to shortest, reading left to right.
2.7 Example The3×3 matrices whose only eigenvalue is1/2 separate into three
similarity classes. The three classes have these canonical representatives.

belongs to the similarity class represented by the middle one, because of the
convention of ordering the blocks of subdiagonal ones.
We are now set up to ﬁnish the program of this chapter. First we review of
what we have so far about transformationst : Cn→ Cn.
Section IV. Jordan Form 453
The diagonalizable case is wheret has n distinct eigenvaluesλ1, ..., λn,
that is, where the number of eigenvalues equals the dimension of the space. In
this case there is a basis⟨⃗β1,..., ⃗βn⟩ where ⃗βi is an eigenvector associated with
the eigenvalueλi. The example below hasn =3 and the three eigenvalues are
λ1 =1,λ2 =3, andλ3 = −1. It shows the canonical representative matrix and
the associated basis.

to get a basis of associated eigenvectors that form disjoint strings. This example

Restated, anyn×n matrix is similar to one in this form.
In the prior example, if we applyt −3 to the basis then it will send two
elements, ⃗β2 and ⃗β3, to ⃗0. This suggests doing the proof by induction since the
dimension of the range spaceR(t −3) is less than that of the starting space.
Proof We will do induction onn. Then =1 base case is trivial since any1×1
matrixisinJordanform. Fortheinductivestepassumethateverytransformation
of C1, ..., Cn−1 has a Jordan form representation and ﬁxt : Cn→ Cn.
Any transformation has at least one eigenvalueλ1 because it has a minimal
polynomial, which has at least one root over the complex numbers. That
eigenvalue has a nonzero eigenvector⃗v, so that (t −λ1)(⃗v) = ⃗0. Thus the
dimension of N (t −λ1), the map’s nullity, is greater than zero. Since the rank
plus the nullity equals the dimension of the domain, the rank oft −λ1 is strictly
less thann. WriteW for the range spaceR(t −λ1) and writer for the rank, its
dimension.
If ⃗w∈W = R(t −λ1) then ⃗w∈ Cn and so (t −λ1)(⃗w)∈ R(t −λ1). Thus
the restriction oft −λ1 toW induces a transformation ofW, which we shall also
callt −λ1. The dimension ofW is less thann and so the inductive hypothesis
applies and we get a basis forW consisting of disjoint strings that are associated
with the eigenvalues oft −λ1 onW. For anyλ that is an eigenvalue oft −λ1,
the transformation of the basis elements will be(t −λ1) −λ = t − (λ1 −λ),
which we will write ast −λs. This diagram shows some strings fort −λ1, that
is, whereλ =0; the argument remains valid if there are no such strings.

The rightmost non-⃗0 vectors ⃗w1,1, ..., ⃗wk,1 are in the null space of the
associated maps, (t −λ1)(⃗w1,1) = ⃗0, ..., (t −λi)(⃗wk,1) = ⃗0. Thus the number
of strings associated witht −λ1, denotedq in the above diagram, is equal to
the dimension ofW∩ N (t −λ1).
The string basis above is for the spaceW = R(t −λ1). We now expand it to
make it a basis for all ofCn. First, because each of the vectors⃗w1,n1, ..., ⃗wq,nq
is an element ofR(t −λ1), each is the image of some vector fromCn. Preﬁx each
string with one such vector,⃗x1, ..., ⃗xq, as shown below. Second, the dimension
ofW∩ N (t −λ1) isq, and the dimension ofW isr, so the bookkeeping requires
that there be a subspaceY⊆ N (t −λ1) with dimensionr −q whose intersection
withW is {⃗0 }. Consequently, pickr −q linearly independent vectors⃗y1, ...,
⃗yr−q∈ N (t −λ1) and incorporate them into the list of strings, again as shown
below.

We will show that this is the desired basis forCn.
Because of the bookkeeping the number of vectors in the set is equal to the
dimension of the space, so we will be done if we verify that its elements are
linearly independent. Assume that this is equal to⃗0.
a1⃗x1 +··· +aq⃗xq +b1,n1 ⃗w1,n1 +··· +bk,1 ⃗wk,1 +c1⃗y1 +··· +cr−q⃗yr−q (∗)
We ﬁrst show that that all of thea’s are zero. Applyt −λ1 to (∗). The vectors
⃗y1, ..., ⃗yr−q go to ⃗0. Each of the vectors⃗xi is sent to ⃗wi,ni. As to the ⃗w’s,
they have the property that(t −λk) ⃗wi,j = ⃗wi,j−1 for someλk. Write ˆλ for
λ1 −λk to get this.
(t −λ1)(⃗wi,j) = (t − (λ1 −ˆλ) +ˆλ)(⃗wi,j) = ⃗wi,j−1 +ˆλ· ⃗wi,j (∗∗)
Thus, applyingt −λ1 to (∗) ends with a linear combination of⃗w’s. These
vectors are linearly independent because they form a basis forW and so in this
456 Chapter Five. Similarity
linear combination the coeﬃcients are0. We will be done showing thatai =0
fori =1,...,q are zero if we verify that after we applyt −λ1 to (∗) then the
coeﬃcient of⃗wi,ni isai. But that’s true because fori =1,...,q , equation (∗∗)
has ˆλ =0 and so ⃗wi,ni is the image ofxi alone.
With thea’s equal to zero, what remains of (∗) is this.
⃗0 =b1,n1 ⃗w1,n1 +··· +bk,1 ⃗wk,1 +c1⃗y1 +··· +cr−q⃗yr−q
Rewrite as−(b1,n1 ⃗w1,n1 +··· +bk,1 ⃗wk,1) =c1⃗y1 +··· +cr−q⃗yr−q. The ⃗w’s are

Consequentlyb1,n1 ⃗w1,n1 +··· +bk,1 ⃗wk,1 = ⃗0 andc1⃗y1 +··· +cr−q⃗yr−q = ⃗0,
and theb’s andc’s are all zero. QED
2.9 Remark Technically, to be a canonical form for matrix similarity, Jordan form
must be unique. That is, for any square matrix there should be one and only
one matrix similar to it that is in Jordan form. We could make the theorem’s
form unique by arranging the Jordan blocks so the eigenvalues are in some
speciﬁed order, and then arranging the blocks of subdiagonal ones from longest
to shortest. In the examples below, we won’t address that.
The examples to follow start with a matrix and calculate a Jordan form
matrix similar to it. Before those we will make one more point. For instance, in
the ﬁrst example belos we ﬁnd that the eigenvalues are2 and6. To pick the basis
elements related to2 we ﬁnd the null spaces oft −2, (t −2)2 and (t −2)3. That
is, to ﬁnd the elements of this example’s basis we will look in the generalized null
spaces N∞(t −2) and N∞(t −6). But we need to be sure that the calculation
for each map does not aﬀect the calculation for the other.
2.10 Deﬁnition Let t :V→V be a transformation. A subspace M⊆ V is t
invariant if whenever ⃗m∈M thent( ⃗m)∈M (shorter: t(M)⊆M).
2.11 Lemma A subspace ist invariant if and only if it ist −λ invariant for all
scalarsλ. In particular, ifλi,λj∈ C are unequal eigenvalues oft then the spaces
N∞(t −λi) and R∞(t −λi) aret −λj invariant.
Proof The right-to-left half of the ﬁrst sentence is trivial: if the subspace is
t −λ invariant for all scalarsλ then takingλ =0 shows that it ist invariant.
For the other half suppose that the subspace ist invariant, so that if⃗m∈M
thent( ⃗m)∈M, and letλ be a scalar. The subspaceM is closed under linear
combinations and so ift( ⃗m)∈M thent( ⃗m) −λ ⃗m∈M. Thus if ⃗m∈M then
(t −λ) (⃗m)∈M.
The second sentence follows from the ﬁrst. The two spaces aret−λi invariant,
so they aret invariant. Applying the ﬁrst sentence again gives that they are
alsot −λj invariant. QED

the null spaces and nullities, is routine. (Recall our convention of takingT to

So the generalized null spaceN∞(t −2) has dimension two. We know that the
restriction oft −2 is nilpotent on this subspace. From the way that the nullities
grow we know that the action oft −2 on a string basis is⃗β1↦→ ⃗β2↦→ ⃗0. Thus
we can represent the restriction in the canonical form

(other choices of basis are possible). Consequently, the action of the restriction

The second eigenvalue is6. Its computations are easier. Because the power of
x −6 in the characteristic polynomial is one, the restriction oft −6 to N∞(t −6)
must be nilpotent, of index one (it can’t be of index less than one and since
x −6 is a factor of the characteristic polynomial with the exponent one it can’t
be of index more than one either). Its action on a string basis must be⃗β3↦→ ⃗0
and since it is the zero map, its canonical formN6 is the1×1 zero matrix.
Consequently, the canonical formJ6 for the action oft on N∞(t −6) is the
1×1 Jordan block matrix with the single entry6. For the basis we can use any
nonzero vector from the generalized null space.
B6 =⟨

where B is the concatenation ofB2 and B6. (If we want to be careful about
getting a unique Jordan form then we could, for instance, rearrange the basis
elements to have the eigenvalues in descending order. But, ascending order is
ﬁne also.)

So the restriction oft −2 to the generalized null space acts on a string basis via
the two strings⃗β1↦→ ⃗0 and ⃗β2↦→ ⃗0. We have this Jordan block associated with
the eigenvalue2.
J2 =
(
2 0
0 2
)
Thus, the contrast with the prior example is that while the characteristic
polynomial tells us to look at the action oft −2 on its generalized null space, the
characteristic polynomial does not completely describet −2’s action. We must
do some computations to ﬁnd that the minimal polynomial is(x −2)(x −6).
For the eigenvalue6, the arguments for the second eigenvalue of the prior
example apply again: because the power ofx −6 in the characteristic polynomial
is one, the restriction oft −6 to N∞(t −6) must be nilpotent of index one.
Alternatively, we can just compute it.

Method of Powers
In applications matrices can be large. Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors
by ﬁnding and solving the characteristic polynomial is impractical, too slow and
too error-prone. Some techniques avoid the characteristic polynomial. Here we
shall see a method that is suitable for large matrices that aresparse, meaning
that the great majority of the entries are zero.
Suppose that then×n matrixT hasn distinct eigenvaluesλ1,λ2, ..., λn.
Then Cn has a basis made of the associated eigenvectors⟨⃗ζ1,..., ⃗ζn⟩. For any
⃗v∈ Cn, writing⃗v =c1⃗ζ1 +··· +cn⃗ζn and iteratingT on ⃗v gives these.
T⃗v =c1λ1⃗ζ1 +c2λ2⃗ζ2 +··· +cnλn⃗ζn

shows that ask gets larger the fractions go to zero and soλ1’s term will dominate
the expression and that expression has a limit ofc1⃗ζ1.
Thus ifc1⁄=0, ask increases the vectorsTk⃗v will tend toward the direction
of the eigenvectors associated with the dominant eigenvalue. Consequently, the
ratios of the vector lengths|Tk⃗v|/|Tk−1⃗v| tend to that dominant eigenvalue.
For example, the eigenvalues of the matrix
T =
(
3 0
8 −1
)
are3 and −1. If ⃗v has the components1 and1 then iterating gives this.

The ratio between the lengths of the last two is2.9999.
We note two implementation issues. First, instead of ﬁnding the powers of
T and applying them to⃗v, we will compute⃗v1 asT⃗v and then compute⃗v2 as
T⃗v1, etc. (that is, we do not separately calculateT2,T3, ...). We can quickly
do these matrix-vector products even ifT is large, provided that it is sparse.
The second issue is that to avoid generating numbers that are so large that they
overﬂow our computer’s capability, we can normalize the⃗vi’s at each step. For
instance, we can divide each⃗vi by its length (other possibilities are to divide it
by its largest component, or simply by its ﬁrst component). We thus implement
this method by generating
⃗w0 = ⃗v0/|⃗v0|
⃗v1 =T ⃗w0
⃗w1 = ⃗v1/|⃗v1|
⃗v2 =T ⃗w2
...
⃗wk−1 = ⃗vk−1/|⃗vk−1|
⃗vk =T ⃗wk
until we are satisﬁed. Then⃗vk is an approximation of an eigenvector, and
the approximation of the dominant eigenvalue is the ratio(T•⃗vk)/(⃗vk•⃗vk)≈
(λ1⃗vk· ⃗vk)/(⃗vk•⃗vk) =λ1.
One way that we could be ‘satisﬁed’ is to iterate until our approximation of
the eigenvalue settles down. We could decide for instance to stop the iteration
process not after some ﬁxed number of steps, but instead when|⃗vk| diﬀers from
|⃗vk−1| by less than one percent, or when they agree up to the second signiﬁcant
digit.
The rate of convergence is determined by the rate at which the powers of
|λ2/λ1| go to zero, whereλ2 is the eigenvalue of second largest length. If that
ratio is much less than one then convergence is fast but if it is only slightly
less than one then convergence can be quite slow. Consequently, the method
of powers is not the most commonly used way of ﬁnding eigenvalues (although
it is the simplest one, which is why it is here). Instead, there are a variety of
methods that generally work by ﬁrst replacing the given matrixT with another
that is similar to it and so has the same eigenvalues, but is in some reduced form
466 Chapter Five. Similarity
such as tridiagonal form, where the only nonzero entries are on the diagonal, or
just above or below it. Then special case techniques can ﬁnd the eigenvalues.
Once we know the eigenvalues then we can easily compute the eigenvectors ofT.
These other methods are outside of our scope. A good reference is [Goult, et al.]

Stable Populations
Imagine a reserve park with animals from a species that we are protecting. The
park doesn’t have a fence so animals cross the boundary, both from the inside
out and from the outside in. Every year,10% of the animals from inside of the
park leave and1% of the animals from the outside ﬁnd their way in. Can we
reach a stable level; are there populations for the park and the rest of the world
that will stay constant over time, with the number of animals leaving equal to
the number of animals entering?
Letpn be the yearn population in the park and letrn be the population in
the rest of the world.
pn+1 =.90pn +.01rn
rn+1 =.10pn +.99rn
We have this matrix equation.
(
pn+1
rn+1
)
=
(
.90 .01
.10 .99
)(
pn
rn
)
The population will be stable ifpn+1 =pn andrn+1 =rn so that the matrix
equation ⃗vn+1 =T⃗vn becomes ⃗v =T⃗v. We are therefore looking for eigenvectors
forT that are associated with the eigenvalueλ =1. The equation⃗0 = (λI−T )⃗v =
(I −T )⃗v is (

−0.10 0.01
)(

=

)
and gives the eigenspace of vectors with the restriction thatp = .1r. For
example, if we start with a park populationp =10000 animals and a rest of the
world population ofr =100000 animals then every year ten percent of those
inside leave the park (this is a thousand animals), and every year one percent of
those from the rest of the world enter the park (also a thousand animals). The
population is stable, self-sustaining.
Topic: Stable Populations 469
Now imagine that we are trying to raise the total world population of this
species. We are trying to have the world population grow at1% per year.
This makes the population level stable in some sense, although it is a dynamic
stability, in contrast to the static population level of theλ =1 case. The equation
⃗vn+1 =1.01· ⃗vn =T⃗vn leads to ((1.01I −T )⃗v = ⃗0, which gives this system.

This matrix is nonsingular and so the only solution isp =0,r =0. Thus there is
no nontrivial initial population that would lead to a regular annual one percent
growth rate inp andr.
We can look for the rates that allow an initial population for the park that
results in a steady growth behavior. We considerλ⃗v =T⃗v and solve forλ.

λ −.9 .01

We already know thatλ =1 is one solution of this characteristic equation. The
other is0.89. Thus there are two ways to have a dynamically stablep andr,
where the two grow at the same rate despite the leaky park boundaries: (i) have
a world population that does not grow or shrink, and (ii) have a world population
that shrinks by11% every year.
So one way to look at eigenvalues and eigenvectors is that they give a stable
state for a system. If the eigenvalue is one then the system is static and if the
eigenvalue isn’t one then it is a dynamic stability.
Exercises
1 For the park discussed above, what should be the initial park population in the
case where the populations decline by11% every year?
2 What will happen to the population of the park in the event of a growth in the
external population of1% per year? Will the park growth rate lag the world or
lead it? Assume that the initial park population is ten thousand, and the world
population is one hundred thousand, and calculate over a ten year span.
3 The park discussed above is partially fenced so that now, every year, only5% of
the animals from inside of the park leave (still, about1% of the animals from the
outside ﬁnd their way in). Under what conditions can the park maintain a stable
population now?
4 Suppose that a species of bird only lives in Canada, the United States, or in Mexico.
Every year,4% of the Canadian birds travel to the US, and1% of them travel to
Mexico. Every year,6% of the US birds travel to Canada, and4% go to Mexico.
From Mexico, every year10% travel to the US, and0% go to Canada.

Page Ranking
Imagine that you are looking for the best book on Linear Algebra. You probably
would try a web search engine such as Google. These lists pages ranked by impor-
tance. The ranking is deﬁned, as Google’s founders have said in [Brin & Page],
that a page is important if other important pages link to it: “a page can have
a high PageRank if there are many pages that point to it, or if there are some
pages that point to it and have a high PageRank.” But isn’t that circular—
how can they tell whether a page is important without ﬁrst deciding on the
important pages? The answer is to use eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
We will present a simpliﬁed version of the Page Rank algorithm. For that
we will model the World Wide Web as a collection of pages connected by links.
This diagram, from [Wills], shows the pages as circles and the links as arrows.
Pagep1 has a link to pagep2. Pagep2 has a link top3. Andp3 has links to
p1,p2, andp3
p1 p2
p3p4
The key idea is that pages that should be highly ranked if they are cited often
by other pages. That is, we raise the importance of a pagepi if it is linked-to
from pagepj. The increment depends on the importance of the linking pagepj
divided by how many out-linksaj are on that page.
I(pi) =
∑
in-linking pagespj
I(pj)
aj
Thus, the importance ofp1 equals1/3 times the importance ofp3, since the
only link top1 comes fromp3. Similarly the importance ofp2 is the sum of the
Topic: Page Ranking 471
importance ofp1 plus1/3 times the importance ofp3.
This stores the information.

The algorithm’s inventors describe a way to think about that matrix.
PageRank can be thought of as a model of user behavior. We
assume there is a ‘random surfer’ who is given a web page at random
and keeps clicking on links, never hitting “back” ... The probability
that the random surfer visits a page is its PageRank. [Brin & Page]
Thus, looking at the ﬁrst row of the matrix, the only way for a random surfer to
get top1 is to have come fromp3. That page has three links so the chance of
clicking onp1’s is1/3 times the chance of being on pagep3.
This brings up the question of pagep4. On the Internet many pages are
dangling or sink links, without any outbound links. What happens to the
random surfer who visits this page? The simplest thing is to imagine that the
surfer chooses the next page entirely at random.

We will ﬁnd vector⃗I whose components are the importance rankings of each
page I(pi). With this notation, our requirements for the page rank are that
H⃗I = ⃗I. That is, we want an eigenvector of the matrix associated with the
eigenvalueλ =1.
Here isSage’s calculation of the eigenvectors (edited to ﬁt the page).

Linear Recurrences
In 1202 Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, posed this problem.
A certain man put a pair of rabbits in a place surrounded on all sides
by a wall. How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that
pair in a year if it is supposed that every month each pair begets a
new pair which from the second month on becomes productive?
This moves past an elementary exponential growth model for populations to
include that newborns are not fertile for some period, here a month. However,
it retains other simplifying assumptions such as that there is an age after which
the rabbits are infertile.
To get next month’s total number of pairs we add the number of pairs alive
going into next month to the number of pairs that will be newly born next
month. The latter equals the number of pairs that will be productive going into
next month, which is the number that next month will have been alive for at
least two months.
F(n) =F(n −1) +F(n −2) whereF(0) =0,F(1) =1 (∗)
On the left is arecurrence relation. It gets that name becauseF recurs in its
own deﬁning equation. On the right are the initial conditions. From (∗) we can
computeF(2),F(3), etc., to work up to the answer for Fibonacci’s question.

We will use linear algebra to get a formula that calculatesF(n) without having
to ﬁrst calculate the intermediate valuesF(2),F(3), etc.
We start by giving (∗) a matrix formulation.

WriteT for the matrix and⃗vn for the vector with componentsF(n) andF(n −1)
so that ⃗vn =Tn−1⃗v1 forn >1. If we diagonalizeT then we have a fast way
to compute its powers: whereT = PDP−1 then Tn = PDnP−1 and then-th

n-th powers of the entries ofD.

Because (1 −

have extended the elementary model of population growth by adding a delay
period before the onset of fertility, we nonetheless still get a function that is
asymptotically exponential.
In general, ahomogeneous linear recurrence relation of orderk has this
form.
f(n) =an−1f(n −1) +an−2f(n −2) +··· +an−kf(n −k)
This recurrence relation is homogeneous because it has no constant term, i.e, we
can rewrite it as0 = −f(n) +an−1f(n −1) +an−2f(n −2) +··· +an−kf(n −k).
It is of orderk because it usesk-many prior terms to calculatef(n). The relation,
cimbined with initial conditions giving values forf(0), ..., f(k −1), completely
determines a sequence, simply because we can computef(n) by ﬁrst computing
f(k),f(k +1), etc. As with the Fibonacci case we will ﬁnd a formula that solves
the recurrence, that directly givesf(n)
LetV be the set of functions with domainN = {0,1,2,... } and codomain
C. (Where convenient we sometimes use the domainZ+ = {1,2,... }.) This is
a vector space under the usual meaning for addition and scalar multiplication,
thatf +g is the mapx↦→f(x) +g(x) andcf is the mapx↦→c·f(x).
If we put aside any initial conditions and look only at the recurrence, then
there may be many functions satisfying the relation. For example, the Fibonacci
recurrence that each value beyond the initial ones is the sum of the prior two is
satisﬁed by the functionL whose ﬁrst few values areL(0) =2,L(1) =1,L(2) =3,
L(3) =4, andL(4) =7.
Fix a homogeneous linear recurrence relation of orderk and consider the
subsetS of functions satisfying the relation (without initial conditions). ThisS
is a subspace ofV. It is nonempty because the zero function is a solution, by
homogeneity. It is closed under addition because iff1 andf2 are solutions then
this holds.

It is also closed under scalar multiplication.

Exercise 4 shows that this is linear. Any solution of the recurrence is uniquely
determined by thek-many initial conditions so this map is one-to-one and onto.
Thus it is an isomorphism, andS has dimensionk.
So we can describe the set of solutions of our linear homogeneous recurrence
relation of orderk by ﬁnding a basis consisting ofk-many linearly independent
functions. To produce those we give the recurrence a matrix formulation.

The± is not relevant to ﬁnd the roots so we drop it. We say that the polynomial
−λk +an−1λk−1 +an−2λk−2 +··· +an−k+1λ +an−k is associated with the
recurrence relation.
If the characteristic equation has no repeated roots then the matrix is
diagonalizable and we can, in theory, get a formula forf(n), as in the Fibonacci
case. But because we know that the subspace of solutions has dimensionk we
do not need to do the diagonalization calculation, provided that we can exhibit
k diﬀerent linearly independent functions satisfying the relation.
Wherer1,r2, ..., rk are the distinct roots, consider the functions of powers
of those roots,fr1 (n) =rn

k. Exercise 6 shows that each is
a solution of the recurrence and that they form a linearly independent set. So, if
the roots of the associated polynomial are distinct, any solution of the relation
has the formf(n) =c1rn
1 +c2rn
2 +··· +ckrn
k for some scalarsc1,...,c n. (The
case of repeated roots is similar but we won’t cover it here; see any text on
Discrete Mathematics.)
Now we bring in the initial conditions. Use them to solve forc1, ..., cn. For
instance, the polynomial associated with the Fibonacci relation is−λ2 +λ +1,
whose roots arer1 = (1 +
√
5)/2 andr2 = (1 −

Fibonacci recurrence has the formf(n) = c1((1 +

We close by considering the nonhomogeneous case, where the relation has
the formf(n +1) =anf(n) +an−1f(n −1) +··· +an−kf(n −k) +b for some
nonzerob. We only need a small adjustment to make the transition from the
homogeneous case.
This classic example illustrates: in 1883, Edouard Lucas posed the Tower of
Hanoi problem.
In the great temple at Benares, beneath the dome which marks
the center of the world, rests a brass plate in which are ﬁxed three
diamond needles, each a cubit high and as thick as the body of a
bee. On one of these needles, at the creation, God placed sixty four
disks of pure gold, the largest disk resting on the brass plate, and
the others getting smaller and smaller up to the top one. This is the
Tower of Brahma. Day and night unceasingly the priests transfer
the disks from one diamond needle to another according to the ﬁxed
and immutable laws of Bram-ah, which require that the priest on
duty must not move more than one disk at a time and that he must
Topic: Linear Recurrences 479
place this disk on a needle so that there is no smaller disk below
it. When the sixty-four disks shall have been thus transferred from
the needle on which at the creation God placed them to one of the
other needles, tower, temple, and Brahmins alike will crumble into
dusk, and with a thunderclap the world will vanish. (Translation of
[De Parville] from [Ball & Coxeter].)
We put aside the question of why the priests don’t sit down for a while and
have the world last a little longer, and instead ask how many disk moves it will
take. Before tackling the sixty four disk problem we will consider the problem
for three disks.
To begin, all three disks are on the same needle.
After the three moves of taking the small disk to the far needle, the mid-sized
disk to the middle needle, and then the small disk to the middle needle, we have
this.
Now we can move the big disk to the far needle. Then to ﬁnish we repeat the
three-move process on the two smaller disks, this time so that they end up on
the third needle, on top of the big disk.
That sequence of moves is the best that we can do. To move the bottom disk
at a minimum we must ﬁrst move the smaller disks to the middle needle, then
move the big one, and then move all the smaller ones from the middle needle to
the ending needle. Since this minimum suﬃces, we get this recurrence.

a linear homogeneous recurrence of order1. Its associated polynomial is−λ +2,
with the single rootr1 =2. Thus functions satisfying the homogeneous relation
take the formc12n.
That’s the homogeneous solution. Now we need a particular solution. Because
the nonhomogeneous relation −1 = −T (n) +2T (n −1) is so simple, we can
by eye spot a particular solutionT (n) = −1. Any solution of the recurrence
T (n) =2T (n −1) +1 (without initial conditions) is the sum of the homogeneous
solution and the particular solution:c12n −1. Now the initial conditionT (1) =1
gives thatc1 =1 and we’ve gotten the formula that generates the table: the
n-disk Tower of Hanoi problem requiresT (n) =2n −1 moves.
Finding a particular solution in more complicated cases is, perhaps not
surprisingly, more complicated. A delightful and rewarding, but challenging,
source is [Graham, Knuth, Patashnik]. For more on the Tower of Hanoi see
[Ball & Coxeter], [Gardner 1957], and [Hofstadter]. Some computer code follows
the exercises.

Coupled Oscillators
This is aWilberforce pendulum. Hanging on the spring is a mass, or bob. Push
it up a bit and release, and it will oscillate up and down.
But then, if the device is properly adjusted, something fascinating happens.
After a few seconds, in addition to going up and down, the mass begins to rotate
about the axis that runs up the middle of the spring. This yaw increases until the
motion becomes almost entirely rotary, with very little up and down. Perhaps
ﬁve seconds later the motion evolves back to a combination. After some more
time, order reappears. Amazingly, now the motion is almost entirely vertical.
This continues, with the device trading oﬀ periods of pure vertical motion with
periods of pure rotational motion, interspersed with mixtures. (Search online
for “wilberforce pendulum video” to get some excellent demonstrations.)
Each pure motion state is anormal modeof oscillation. We will analyze
this device’s behavior when it is in a normal mode. It is all about eigenvalues.
θ(t)
x(t)
Writex(t) for the vertical motion over time andθ(t) for the rotational motion.
Fix the coordinate system so that in rest positionx = 0 and θ = 0, so that
positivex’s are up, and so that positiveθ’s are counterclockwise when viewed
from above.
Topic: Coupled Oscillators 483
We start by modeling the motion of a mass on a spring constrained to have
no twist. This is simpler because there is only one motion, one degree of freedom.
Put the mass in rest position and push it up to compress the spring. Hooke’s
Law is that for small distances the restoring force is proportional to the distance,
F = −k·x. The constantk is thestiﬀnessof the spring.
Newton’s Law is that a force is proportional to the associated acceleration
F = m·d2x(t)/dt. The constant of proportionality,m, is themass of the
object. Combining Hooke’s Law with Newton’s gives the diﬀerential equation
expressing the mass’s motionm·d2x(t)/dt = −k·x(t). We prefer the from
with the variables all on one side.
m·d2x(t)
dt +k·x(t) =0 (∗)
Our physical intuition is that over time the bob oscillates. It started high so
the graph should look like this.
position x
time t
Of course, this looks like a cosine graph and we recognize that the diﬀerential
equation of motion (∗) is satisﬁed byx(t) = cosωt, whereω =
√
m/k, since
dx/dt = ω· sinωt and d2x/dt2 = −ω2· cosωt. Here, ω is the angular
frequency. It governs the period of the oscillation since ifω =1 then the period
is2π, while ifω =2 then the period isπ, etc.
We can give a more general solution of (∗). For a general amplitude we put
a factorA in frontx(t) =A·coswt. And we can allow a phase shift, so we are
not required to start the clock when the mass is high, withx(t) =Acos(wt +φ).
This is the equation ofsimple harmonic motion.
Now back to consideration of the coupled pair of motions, vertical and
rotational. These two interact because a spring that is twisted will lengthen
or shorten just a bit; for instance, it could work as here or could be reversed,
depending on the spring.
spring lengthens spring shortens
And, a spring that is stretched or compressed from its rest position will twist
slightly. The interaction of the two producescoupled oscillations.
484 Chapter Five. Similarity
To see how the interaction can produce the dramatic behavior that we see
in a normal mode imagine that the mass is rotating in the direction that will
make the spring longer. If at the same moment the vertical motion is that the
spring is getting shorter, then superimposing the two could result in their almost
canceling. The bob ends up not moving vertically much at all, just twisting.
With a properly adjusted device this could last for a number of seconds.
“Properly adjusted” means that the period of the pure vertical motion is the
same as, or close to, the period of the pure rotational motion. With that, the
cancellation will go on for some time.
The interaction between the motions can also produce the other normal
mode behavior, where the bob moves mostly vertically without much rotation,
if the spring’s motionx(t) produces a twist that opposes the bob’s twistθ(t).
The bob will stop rotating, almost, so that its motion is almost entirely vertical.
To get the equations of motion in this two degrees of freedom case, we make
the same assumption as in the one degree case, that for small displacements
the restoring force is proportional to the displacement. But now we take that
assumption both for the vertical motion and for the rotation. Let the constant
of proportionality in the rotational motion beκ. Similarly we also use Newton’s
Law that force is proportional to acceleration for the rotational motion as well,
and take the constant of proportionality to beI.
Most crucially, we add a coupling between the two motions, which we take
to be proportional to each, with constant of proportionalityϵ/2.
That gives a system of two diﬀerential equations, the ﬁrst for vertical motion
and the second for rotation. These equations describe the behavior of the coupled
system at any timet.

2·θ(t) =0

We will use them to analyze the system’s behavior at times when it is in a
normal mode.
First consider the uncoupled motions, as given by the equations without the
ϵ terms. Without those terms these describe simple harmonic functions, and
we writeω2
x fork/m, andω2
θ forκ/I. We have argued above that to observe
the stand-still behavior we should adjust the device so that the periods are the
sameω2
x =ω2
θ. Writeω0 for that number.
Now consider the coupled motionsx(t) andθ(t). By the same principle, to
observe the stand-still behavior we want them in in sync, for instance so that
the rotation is at its peak when the stretch is at its peak. That is, in a normal
mode the oscillations have the same angular frequencyω. As to phase shift, as
Topic: Coupled Oscillators 485
we also discussed there are two cases: when the twist imparted by the spring’s
motion is in the same direction as the twist given by the rotational oscillation
and when they are opposed. In either case to get a normal mode the peaks must
coincide.
x(t) =A1cos(ωt +φ) x(t) =A1cos(ωt +φ)
θ(t) =A2cos(ωt +φ) θ(t) =A2cos(ωt + (φ +π))
We will work through the left-hand case, leaving the other as an exercise.
We want to ﬁnd whichω’s are possible. Take the second derivatives

dt = −A1ω2cos(ωt +φ) d2θ(t)
dt = −A2ω2cos(ωt +φ)

Although the argument is beyond our scope, the general formula for the
motion of the pendulum is a linear combination of the motions during the normal
modes. Thus, the pendulum’s motion is entirely determined by the eigenvalues
of the above matrix. See [Berg & Marshall].

Appendix
Mathematics is made of arguments (reasoned discourse that is, not crockery-
throwing). This section sketches the background material and argument tech-
niques that we use in the book.
This section informally outlines the topics, skipping proofs. For more,
[Velleman2] is excellent. Two other sources, available online, are [Hefferon]
and [Beck].
Statements
Formal mathematical statements come labelled as aTheorem for major points,
a Corollary for results that follow immediately from a prior one, or aLemma
for results chieﬂy used to prove others.
Statements can be complex and have many parts. The truth or falsity of the
entire statement depends both on the truth value of the parts and on how the
statement is put together.
Not WhereP is a proposition, ‘it is not the case thatP’ is true provided that
P is false. For instance, ‘n is not prime’ is true only whenn is the product of
smaller integers.
To prove that a ‘notP’ statement holds, show thatP is false.
And For a statement of the form ‘P andQ’ to be true both halves must hold:
‘7 is prime and so is3’ is true, while ‘7 is prime and3 is not’ is false.
To prove a ‘P andQ’, prove each half.
Or A ‘P orQ’ statement is true when either half holds: ‘7 is prime or4 is prime’
is true, while ‘8 is prime or4 is prime’ is false. In the case that both clauses of
the statement are true, as in ‘7 is prime or3 is prime’, we take the statement
as a whole to be true. (In everyday speech people occasionally use ‘or’ in an
exclusive way—“Live free or die” does not intend both halves to hold—but we
will not use ‘or’ in that way.)
A-2
To prove ‘P orQ’, show that in all cases at least one half holds (perhaps
sometimes one half and sometimes the other, but always at least one).
If-then An ‘ifP thenQ’ statement may also appear as ‘P impliesQ’ or ‘P =⇒ Q’
or ‘P is suﬃcient to giveQ’ or ‘Q ifP’. It is true unlessP is true whileQ is
false. Thus ‘if7 is prime then4 is not’ is true while ‘if7 is prime then4 is also
prime’ is false. (Contrary to its use in casual speech, in mathematics ‘ifP then
Q’ does not connote thatP precedesQ or causesQ.)
Note this consequence of the prior paragraph: ifP is false then ‘ifP thenQ’
is true irrespective of the value ofQ: ‘if4 is prime then7 is prime’ and ‘if4 is
prime then7 is not’ are both true statements. (They arevacuously true.) Also
observe that ‘ifP thenQ’ is true whenQ is true: ‘if4 is prime then7 is prime’
and ‘if4 is not prime then7 is prime’ are both true.
There are two main ways to establish an implication. The ﬁrst way is
direct: assume thatP is true and use that assumption to proveQ. For instance,
to show ‘if a number is divisible by 5 then twice that number is divisible by
10’ we can assume that the number is5n and deduce that2(5n) = 10n. The
indirect way is to prove thecontrapositive statement: ‘ifQ is false thenP is
false’ (rephrased, ‘Q can only be false whenP is also false’). Thus to show ‘if a
natural number is prime then it is not a perfect square’ we can argue that if it
were a squarep =n2 then it could be factoredp =n·n wheren<p and so
wouldn’t be prime (p =0 orp =1 don’t satisfyn<p but they are nonprime).
Equivalent statements Sometimes, not only doesP implyQ but alsoQ impliesP.
Some ways to say this are: ‘P if and only ifQ’, ‘P iﬀQ’, ‘P andQ are logically
equivalent’, ‘P is necessary and suﬃcient to giveQ’, ‘P ⇐⇒ Q’. An example is
‘an integer is divisible by ten if and only if that number ends in0’.
Although in simple arguments a chain like “P if and only ifR, which holds if
and only ifS ...” may be practical, to prove that statements are equivalent we
more often prove the two halves ‘ifP thenQ’ and ‘ifQ thenP’ separately.
Quantiﬁers
Compare these statements about natural numbers: ‘there is a natural numberx
such thatx is divisible byx2’ is true, while ‘for all natural numbersx, thatx is
divisible byx2’ is false. The preﬁxes ‘there is’ and ‘for all’ arequantiﬁers.
For all The ‘for all’ preﬁx is theuniversal quantiﬁer, symbolized∀.
The most straightforward way to prove that a statement holds in all cases is
to prove that it holds in each case. Thus to show that ‘every number divisible by
p has its square divisible byp2’, take a single number of the formpn and square
it (pn)2 =p2n2. This is atypical element proof. (In this kind of argument
be careful not to assume properties for that element other than the ones in the
A-3
hypothesis. This argument is wrong: “Ifn is divisible by a prime, say2, so that
n =2k for some natural numberk, thenn2 = (2k)2 =4k2 and the square ofn
is divisible by the square of the prime.” That is a proof for the special casep =2
but it isn’t a proof for allp. Contrast it with a correct one: “Ifn is divisible
by a prime so thatn =pk for some natural numberk thenn2 = (pk)2 =p2k2
and so the square ofn is divisible by the square of the prime.”)
There exists The ‘there exists’ preﬁx is theexistential quantiﬁer, symbolized∃.
We can prove an existence proposition by producing something satisfying
the property: for instance, to settle the question of primality of225
+1, Euler
exhibited the divisor641[Sandifer]. But there are proofs showing that something
exists without saying how to ﬁnd it; Euclid’s argument given in the next
subsection shows there are inﬁnitely many primes without giving a formula
naming them.
Finally, after “Are there any?” we often ask “How many?” That is, the
question of uniqueness often arises in conjunction with the question of existence.
Sometimes the two arguments are simpler if separated so note that just as
proving something exists does not show that it is unique, neither does proving
that something is unique show that it exists.
Techniques of Proof
We have many ways to prove mathematical statements. Here we will outline
two techniques that we use often, and that might not come naturally, even to a
person with a technical turn of mind.
Induction Many proofs are iterative, “Here’s why the statement is true for the
number0, it then follows for1 and from there to2 ...”. These are proofs by
mathematical induction. We will see two examples.
We will ﬁrst prove that1 +2 +3 +··· +n =n(n +1)/2. That formula has
a natural number variablen that is free, meaning that settingn to be1, or
2, etc., gives a family of cases of the statement: ﬁrst that1 =1(2)/2, second
that1 +2 =2(3)/2, etc. Our induction proofs involve statements with one free
natural number variable.
Each such proof has two steps. In thebase stepwe show that the statement
holds for some intial numberi∈ N. Often this step is a routine veriﬁcation.
The second step, theinductive step, is more subtle; we will show that this
implication holds:
If the statement holds fromn =i up to and includingn =k
then the statement holds also in then =k +1 case (∗)
(the ﬁrst line is theinductive hypothesis). Completing both steps proves that
the statement is true for all natural numbers greater than or equal toi.
A-4
For the sum of the initialn numbers statement the intuition behind the
principle is that ﬁrst, the base step directly veriﬁes the statement for the case
of the initial numbern = 1. Then, because the inductive step veriﬁes the
implication (∗) for all k, that implication applied tok = 1 gives that the
statement is true for the case of the numbern =2. Now, with the statement
established for both1 and2, apply (∗) again to conclude that the statement is
true for the numbern =3. In this way, we bootstrap to all numbersn >1.
Here is a proof of1 +2 +3 +··· +n =n(n +1)/2, with separate paragraphs
for the base step and the inductive step.
For the base step we show that the formula holds whenn =1. That’s
easy; the sum of the ﬁrst1 natural number equals1(1 +1)/2.
For the inductive step, assume the inductive hypothesis that the formula
holds for the numbersn = 1, n = 2, ..., n = k with k > 1. That is,
assume1 =1(1)/2, and1 +2 =2(3)/2, and1 +2 +3 =3(4)/2, through
1 +2 +··· +k = k(k +1)/2. With that, the formula holds also in the
n =k +1 case:
1 +2 +··· +k + (k +1) = k(k +1)
2 + (k +1) = (k +1)(k +2)
2
(the ﬁrst equality follows from the inductive hypothesis).
Here is another example, proving that every integer greater than or equal to
2 is a product of primes.
The base step is easy:2 is the product of a single prime.
For the inductive step assume that each of2,3,...,k is a product of primes,
aiming to showk+1 is also a product of primes. There are two possibilities.
First, ifk +1 is not divisible by a number smaller than itself then it is a
prime and so is the product of primes. The second possibility is thatk +1
is divisible by a number smaller than itself, and then by the inductive
hypothesis its factors can be written as a product of primes. In either case
k +1 can be rewritten as a product of primes.
Contradiction Another technique of proof is to show that something is true by
showing that it cannot be false. A proof by contradiction assumes that the
proposition is false and derives some contradiction to known facts.
The classic example of proof by contradiction is Euclid’s argument that there
are inﬁnitely many primes.
Suppose that there are only ﬁnitely many primesp1,...,p k. Consider the
numberp1·p2...p k +1. None of the primes on the supposedly exhaustive
list divides this number evenly since each leaves a remainder of1. But
every number is a product of primes so this can’t be. Therefore there
cannot be only ﬁnitely many primes.
A-5
Another example is this proof that
√
2 is not a rational number.
Suppose that
√
2 =m/n, so that2n2 =m2. Factor out any2’s, giving
n =2kn· ˆn andm =2km· ˆm. Rewrite.
2· (2kn· ˆn)2 = (2km· ˆm)2
The Prime Factorization Theorem says that there must be the same number
of factors of2 on both sides, but there are an odd number of them1 +2kn
on the left and an even number2km on the right. That’s a contradiction,
so a rational number with a square of2 is impossible.
Sets, Functions, and Relations
The material here forms the backdrop, the vocabulary, for all of the development
that we do.
Sets Mathematicians often work with collections. The most commonly-used kind
of collection is aset. Sets are characterized by the Principle of Extensionality:
two sets with the same elements are equal. Because of this, the order of the
elements does not matter{2,π } = {π,2 }, and repeats collapse{7,7 } = {7 }.
We can describe a set using a listing between curly braces{1,4,9,16 } (as
in the prior paragraph), or by using set-builder notation{x |x5 −3x3 +2 =0 }
(read “the set of allx such that ...”). We name sets with capital roman letters;
for instance the set of primes isP = {2,3,5,7,11,... } (except that a few sets
are so important that their names are reserved, such as the real numbersR and
the complex numbersC). To denote that something is anelement, ormember,)
of a set we use ‘∈’, so that7∈ {3,5,7 } while8⁄∈ {3,5,7 }.
We say thatA is asubset ofB, writtenA⊆B, whenx∈A implies that
x∈B. In this book we use ‘⊂’ for theproper subsetrelationship thatA is a
subset ofB butA⁄=B (some authors use this symbol for any kind of subset,
proper or not). An example is{2,π }⊂ {2,π,7 }. These symbols may be ﬂipped,
for instance {2,π,5 }⊃ {2,5 }.
Because of Extensionality, to prove that two sets are equalA =B show that
they have the same members. Often we do this by showing mutual inclusion,
that bothA⊆ B and A⊇ B. Such a proof will have a part showing that if
x∈A thenx∈B, and a second part showing that ifx∈B thenx∈A.
When a set has no members then it is theempty set { }, symbolized ∅.
Any set has the empty set for a subset by the ‘vacuously true’ property of the
deﬁnition of implication.
Diagrams We picture basic set operations with aVenn diagram. This shows
x∈P.
A-6

The outer rectangle contains the universeΩ of all objects under discussion. For
instance, in a statement about real numbers, the rectangle encloses all members
of R. The set is pictured as a circle, enclosing its members.
Here is the diagram forP⊆Q. It shows that ifx∈P thenx∈Q.
P Q
Set Operations The union of two sets isP∪Q = {x | (x∈P) or (x∈Q) }. The
diagram shows that an element is in the union if it is in either of the sets.

The intersection isP∩Q = {x | (x∈P) and (x∈Q) }.

Multisets As described above, a set is a collection in which order does not matter,
so that the sets{2,π } and {π,2 } are equal, and in which repeats collapse, so
that the sets{7,7 } and {7 } are equal.
A-7
A collection that is like a set in that order does not matter, but in which
repeats do not collapse, is amultiset. (Note that we use the same curly brackets
notation {... } as for sets.) Thus the multiset{1,2,2 } diﬀers from the multiset
{1,2 }. Because order does not matter, these multisets are all equal:{1,2,2 },
{2,1,2 }, and {2,2,1 }. In this text we only mention multisets in a remark so
going into how to do subsets, unions, or intersections, is beyond our scope.
Sequences In addition to sets and multisets, we also use collections where order
matters and where repeats do not collapse. These aresequences, denoted with
angle brackets:⟨2,3,7⟩⁄ =⟨2,7,3⟩. A sequence of length2 is anordered pair,
and is often written with parentheses:(π,3 ). We also sometimes say ‘ordered
triple’, ‘ordered4-tuple’, etc. The set of orderedn-tuples of elements of a setA
is denotedAn. Thus R2 is the set of pairs of reals.
Functions A function or map f :D→C is is an association between input
argumentsx∈Dandoutput valuesf(x)∈Csubjecttothetherequirementthat
the function must bewell-deﬁned, thatx suﬃces to determinef(x). Restated,
the condition is that ifx1 =x2 thenf(x1) =f(x2).
The set of all argumentsD isf’sdomain and the set of output values is
its range R(f). Often we don’t work with the range and instead work with
a convenient superset, thecodomainC. For instance, we might describe the
squaring function withs : R→ R instead ofs : R→ R+∪ {0 }.
We picture functions with abean diagram.
The blob on the left is the domain while on the right is the codomain. The
function associates the three points of the domain with three in the codomain.
Note that by the deﬁnition of a function every point in the domain is associated
with a unique point in the codomain, but the converse needn’t be true.
The association is arbitrary; no formula or algorithm is required, although in
this book there typically is one. We often usey to denotef(x). We also use the
notationx
f
↦−→16x2 −100, read ‘x maps underf to16x2 −100’ or ‘16x2 −100
is theimage ofx’.
A map such asx↦→ sin(1/x) is a combinations of simpler maps, hereg(y) =
sin(y) applied to the image off(x) =1/x. Thecomposition ofg :Y→Z with
f :X→Y, is the map sendingx∈X tog(f(x) )∈Z. It is denotedg◦f :X→Z.
This deﬁnition only makes sense if the range off is a subset of the domain ofg.
A-8
An identity mapid :Y→Y deﬁned byid(y) =y has the property that for
anyf :X→Y, the compositionid◦f is equal tof. So an identity map plays the
same role with respect to function composition that the number0 plays in real
number addition or that1 plays in multiplication.
In line with that analogy, we deﬁne aleft inverse of a mapf :X→Y to be
a functiong : range(f)→X such thatg◦f is the identity map onX. A right
inverse off is ah :Y→X such thatf◦h is the identity.
For somef’s there is a map that is both a left and right inverse off. If such
a map exists then it is unique because if bothg1 and g2 have this property
theng1(x) = g1◦ (f◦g2) (x) = (g1◦f)◦g2 (x) = g2(x) (the middle equality
comes from the associativity of function composition) so we call it atwo-sided
inverse or just“the” inverse, and denote itf−1. For instance, the inverse of
the functionf : R→ R given byf(x) =2x −3 is the functionf−1 : R→ R given
byf−1(x) = (x +3)/2.
The superscript notation for function inverse ‘f−1’ ﬁts into a larger scheme.
Functions with the same codomain as domainf :X→X can be iterated, so that
we can consider the composition off with itself:f◦f, andf◦f◦f, etc. We write
f◦f asf2 andf◦f◦f asf3, etc. Note that the familiar exponent rules for real
numbers hold:fi◦fj =fi+j and (fi)j =fi·j. Then wheref is invertible, writing
f−1 for the inverse andf−2 for the inverse off2, etc., gives that these familiar
exponent rules continue to hold, since we deﬁnef0 to be the identity map.
The deﬁnition of function requires that for every input there is one and only
one associated output value. If a functionf :D→C has the additional property
that for every output value there is at least one associated input value—that is,
the additional property thatf’s codomain equals its rangeC = R(f)—then the
function isonto.
A function has a right inverse if and only if it is onto. (Thef pictured above
has a right inverseg :C→D given by following the arrows backwards, from
right to left. For the codomain point on the top, choose either one of the arrows
to follow. With that, applyingg ﬁrst followed byf takes elementsy∈C to
themselves, and so is the identity function.)
If a functionf :D→C has the property that for every output value there is
at most one associated input value—that is, if no two arguments share an image
so thatf(x1) = f(x2) implies thatx1 =x2—then the function isone-to-one.
The bean diagram from earlier illustrates.
A-9
A function has a left inverse if and only if it is one-to-one. (In the picture deﬁne
g :C→D to follow the arrows backwards for thosey∈C that are at the end of
an arrow, and to send the point to an arbitrary element inD otherwise. Then
applyingf followed byg to elements ofD will act as the identity.)
By the prior paragraphs, a map has a two-sided inverse if and only if that map
is both onto and one-to-one. Such a function is acorrespondence. It associates
one and only one element of the domain with each element of the codomain.
Because a composition of one-to-one maps is one-to-one, and a composition of
onto maps is onto, a composition of correspondences is a correspondence.
We sometimes want to shrink the domain of a function. For instance, we
may take the functionf : R→ R given byf(x) = x2 and, in order to have an
inverse, limit input arguments to nonnegative realsˆf : R+∪ {0 }→ R. Then ˆf is
the restriction off to the smaller domain.
Relations Some familiar mathematical things, such as ‘<’ or ‘=’, are most
naturally understood as relations between things. Abinary relationon a set
A is a set of ordered pairs of elements ofA. For example, some elements of
the set that is the relation ‘<’ on the integers are(3,5 ), (3,7 ), and (1,100 ).
Another binary relation on the integers is equality; this relation is the set
{..., (−1,1 ), (0,0 ), (1,1 ),... }. Still another example is ‘closer than10’, the set
{(x,y ) | |x −y|<10 }. Some members of this relation are(1,10 ), (10,1 ), and
(42,44 ). Neither (11,1 ) nor (1,11 ) is a member.
Those examples illustrate the generality of the deﬁnition. All kinds of
relationships (e.g., ‘both numbers even’ or ‘ﬁrst number is the second with the
digits reversed’) are covered.
Equivalence Relations We shall need to express that two objects are alike in
some way. They aren’t identical, but they are related (e.g., two integers that
give the same remainder when divided by2).
A binary relation { (a,b ),... } is anequivalence relationwhen it satisﬁes
(1) reﬂexivity: any object is related to itself, (2)symmetry: if a is related
tob thenb is related toa, and (3)transitivity: ifa is related tob andb is
related toc thena is related toc. Some examples (on the integers): ‘=’ is an
equivalence relation, ‘<’ does not satisfy symmetry, ‘same sign’ is a equivalence,
while ‘nearer than10’ fails transitivity.
Partitions In the ‘same sign’ relation{(1,3 ), (−5, −7), (0,0 ),... } there are three
A-10
kinds of pairs, pairs with both numbers positive, pairs with both negative, and
the one pair with both zero. So integers fall into exactly one of three classes,
positive, or negative, or zero.
A partition of a setΩ is a collection of subsets{S0,S1,S2,... } such that
every element ofS is an element of a subsetS1∪S2∪··· =Ω and overlapping
parts are equal: ifSi∩Sj⁄= ∅ thenSi =Sj. Picture thatΩ is decomposed into
non-overlapping parts.
...S0
S1 S2
S3
Thus the prior paragraph says that ‘same sign’ partitions the integers into the
set of positives, the set of negatives, and the set containing only zero. Similarly,
the equivalence relation ‘=’ partitions the integers into one-element sets.
Another example is the set of strings consisting of a number, followed by
a slash, followed by a nonzero numberΩ = {n/d |n,d∈ Z andd⁄=0 }. Deﬁne
Sn,d by: ˆn/ˆd∈ Sn,d if ˆnd = nˆd. Checking that this is a partition ofΩ is
routine (observe for instance thatS4,3 =S8,6). This shows some parts, listing
in each a couple of its inﬁnitely many members.
...
.0/1
.0/3
.1/1
.2/2 .2/4
. −2/−4
.4/3
.8/6
Every equivalence relation induces a partition, and every partition is induced
by an equivalence. (This is routine to check.) Below are two examples.
Consider the equivalence relationship between two integers of ‘gives the same
remainder when divided by2’, the setP = {(−1,3 ), (2,4 ), (0,0 ),... }. In the setP
are two kinds of pairs, the pairs with both members even and the pairs with both
members odd. This equivalence induces a partition where the parts are found
by: for eachx we deﬁne the set of numbers related to itSx = {y | (x,y )∈P }.
The parts are{..., −3, −1,1,3,... } and {..., −2,0,2,4,... }. Each part can be
named in many ways; for instance,{..., −3, −1,1,3,... } isS1 and also isS−3.
Now consider the partition of the natural numbers where two numbers are
in the same part if they leave the same remainder when divided by10, that
is, if they have the same least signiﬁcant digit. This partition is induced by
the equivalence relationR deﬁned by: two numbersn, m are related if they
are together in the same part. For example,3 is related to33, but3 is not
A-11
related to102. Verifying the three conditions in the deﬁnition of equivalence
are straightforward.
We call each part of a partition anequivalence class. We sometimes pick a
single element of each equivalence class to be theclass representative.
...⋆

⋆
Usually when we pick representatives we have some natural scheme in mind. In
that case we call them thecanonical representatives. An example is that two
fractions3/5 and9/15 are equivalent. In everyday work we often prefer to use
the ‘simplest form’ or ‘reduced form’ fraction3/5 as the class representative.
